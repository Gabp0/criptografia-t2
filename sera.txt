His intentions were ofXthe best; his industry, as a rule, was proof against distractions.XThis day, though, there was something in the very air which seemed toXinterfere with his work.XXIt was a fine day, a beautiful day. The sun shone brightly; a pleasantXbreeze was blowing; beyond the open windows of the big assembly hallXon the third floor of the high school tree tops were swaying gently.XIn spite of his efforts SamXXXs gaze strayed to them, and lingered onXthem, to the sad neglect of the instructive remarks on the EnglishXparagraph, offered by the text-book lying open on his desk. TopicXsentences, somehow, had lost their hold; XXXproofsXXX no longer appealed toXhis reason; conclusions didnXXXt matter in the least. Sam felt the spellXof the spring in his blood, and, to do him justice, fought against itsXinfluence.XXAs a student, the boy had to earn what he gained. He didnXXXt lack brainsXby any manner of means; and he stood well in his classes, but this wasXthe result of application rather than of inspiration. He had come upXto the hall for a study period because it was quieter than his XXXhomeXXXXroom, where a recitation was in progress; and a score of other pupilsXhad followed the same plan. They were rather widely scattered in theXbig space of the hall, and the teacher who was charged with maintainingXorder had the easiest of tasks. Spring fever might not promoteXindustry, but likewise it did not encourage mischief.XXFrom the window SamXXXs glance came back to his comrades of the studyXhour. Nearly all were classmates of his--Juniors--but only twoXwere among his special chums. Over in a corner a slender boy withXthick-lensed spectacles was deep in a calculation, being by longXodds the busiest person in the room. Sam, surveying him, chuckled.XWilly Reynolds, known to his friends as the XXXSharkXXX because of hisXextraordinary appetite for mathematics, cared very little what theXweather might be, or whether the season were winter, summer, springXor autumn, so long as he was provided with an interesting problem. AtXa little distance from the Shark XXXTrojanXXX Walker was dallying withXan English exercise. Sam grinned sympathetically, while he watchedXthe slow motion of the TrojanXXXs pencil; he knew just how his friendXwas longing to be out-of-doors and making holiday. Trojan was a goodXfellow, rather a quiet chap, neither a dullard nor brilliant at hisXbooks; likable, dependable, and a valued member of the little coterie,Xof which Sam was the acknowledged leader.XXSamXXXs smile faded as his glance passed from Walker to a brace of hisXneighbors. He was not fond of Jack Hagle, and he disliked Edward Zorn.XIn the case of the former he might have found it hard to put the reasonXfor his opinion into words. Hagle never had harmed him; at times heXhad tried to be friendly; but there was something in JackXXXs personalityXwhich didnXXXt appeal to Sam. XXXHagle puts a fellowXXXs teeth on edge,XsomehowXXX--so Sam had said more than once, and it would have puzzledXhim to make the explanation more definite. As for Zorn--well, he was aXschemer, an intriguer, a school and class politician, always workingXfor this, that, or the other thing; now fawning, now blustering, butXalways keeping the personal fortunes of Edward Zorn in mind. Once orXtwice Sam and his chums had clashed with Zorn and his allies, and theXencounters had not left the feeling of respect one sometimes finds forXa stout and honest adversary.XXSam turned again to consideration of the English paragraph. He tried toXconcentrate his attention upon the printed page before him, and so wasXnot aware that the principal and the sub-master had entered the hallXand were talking earnestly with the teacher on duty. The conference atXthe desk went on for several minutes. The sub-master appeared to beXexcited. His voice rose a trifle, and Sam looked up. By this time allXthe pupils were eyeing the group on the platform with varying degreesXof interest.XXSuddenly the sub-master turned to his chief and put a question. WhatXit was nobody in the body of the hall heard, but everybody saw theXprincipal nod agreement. To Sam at least the agreement did not seem toXbe at all eager.XXXXXWalker!XXX the sub-master called out sharply.XXThe Trojan gave a start of surprise at the summons; rose; went forward.XThe principal put a query, his tone so low that the words wereXinaudible a dozen feet from the platform.XXXXXWhy--why, I donXXXt know, sir.XXXXXSam, straining his ears, barely caught the TrojanXXXs answer. He quiteXmissed both the next question and the reply. Then the sub-master put inXa suggestion:XXXXXSuppose we excuse Walker for a moment. We can--er--er--we can recallXhim later.XXXXXAgain the principal nodded. Sam, closely attentive, was more stronglyXimpressed than before that the head of the school was not enjoying theXmoment.XXThe Trojan walked back to his desk. His expression was puzzled. SamXXXsXguess was that he was racking his memory and failing to recallXdistinctly something about which he ought not to have been uncertain.XXXXXHagle!XXX said the sub-master.XXJack shuffled up the aisle and took his stand before the teachers. HisXexamination was longer than the TrojanXXXs, but the other pupils heardXnot a word of it. Then Zorn was called, and again there was an exchangeXalmost in whispers.XXThe sub-master consulted a list of names written on a card.XXXXXParker!XXX he said, after a momentXXXs reflection.XXSam made his way to the platform. By this time his curiosity was keenXenough. Zorn, he noticed, had not gone back to his former seat, butXhad taken a place well forward, where he hardly could escape hearingXwhatever might be said.XXXXXThatXXXs a cheeky performance!XXX Sam told himself--and then forgot ZornXfor the moment; for the sub-master was addressing him.XXXXXParker, perhaps you can help us. There is a point we wish toXestablish. In a case of--er--er--in a case of disputed ownership of aXbook, let us say, suppose Walker claimed it----XXXXXXXXThen IXXXd say it was the TrojanXXXs--I mean, WalkerXXXs,XXX Sam declaredXwithout hesitation.XXXXXThat is because you are a great friend of his?XXXXXXXXItXXXs because Trojan always tells the truth, sir.XXXXXXXXI see. You give him a general vote of confidence?XXXXXXXXYes, sir.XXXXXSam fancied that the principal moved uneasily, as if he didnXXXt like theXcourse the examination was taking. Yet the head of the school permittedXhis assistant to go on.XXXXXWell, Parker, it happens that the ownership of a certain book isXa matter of some interest to us. We are anxious to establish itXdefinitely. By the wayXXX--the sub-master pushed aside a paper on theXdesk and revealed a worn and battered text-book it had concealed--XXXbyXthe way, can you tell us anything about this?XXXXXSam picked up the book. He glanced at the fly-leaves. They were tornXand dog-eared, and bore a dozen scribbled entries. It was plain enoughXthat the book had been handed down from class to class, though it wouldXhave puzzled anybody to get much clew to its present ownership fromXthe conflicting scrawls. Then Sam turned to the last printed page, andXfound there a penciled skull and crossbones.XXXXXIf Trojan says this is his Cicero, heXXXs right, sir.XXXXXXXXYou--er--er--you corroborate him, then?XXXXXAgain Sam sensed the principalXXXs lack of approval of the question; butXmade mental note, too, that he let the sub-master continue.XXXXXYes, sir,XXX said the boy; XXXthough he doesnXXXt need corroboration.XXXXXXXXYouXXXre absolutely sure?XXXXXXXXI ought to be--I drew that picture on the last page. Did it one dayXwhen IXXXd borrowed the book from Trojan.XXXXXXXXLong ago?XXXXXXXXTwo or three months.XXXXXThe sub-master frowned. XXXThat is somewhat remote, Parker. If you haveXa weakness for decorative effects, there has been time since thenXfor you to adorn other texts. And if you havenXXXt seen this book inXmonths----XXXXXXXXBut I have seen it, sir!XXX Sam broke in. XXXWhen? Last Friday. JustXbefore our class went in for its Latin test I borrowed the book fromXTrojan to look up a passage. It--itXXXs pretty freely marked with notesXon hard places, you know.XXXXXXXXSo I perceive,XXX said the sub-master drily.XXSam coughed. XXXAhem, ahem! Well, the fellows whoXXXve had it have writtenXin a lot of things, sir. And--and they help, when youXXXre in a hurry.XAnd there was one XXXstickerXXX I _did_ want to get straight before weXtackled the examination.XXXXXXXXVery much of an eleventh-hour performance, wasnXXXt it?XXXXXXXXYes, sir. We were in the corridor--just before we went in.XXXXXXXXAnd you are sure you returned the book?XXXXXXXXPerfectly sure, sir. Trojan wanted it back--he had something to lookXup, too.XXXXXXXXAnd you gave it to him?XXXXXSam smiled faintly. XXXXXXGaveXXX is hardly the word, sir--he grabbed it.XXXXXXXXThat was the last you saw of the book--in WalkerXXXs hands, in theXcorridor, outside the examination room?XXXXXXXXRight there, sir.XXXXXXXXBut you had your own Cicero with you?XXXXXXXXI guess all the fellows had theirs. But we left them in theXcorridor--thatXXXs the way we always do, you know.XXXXXThe sub-master turned to the principal. XXXWell, some things seem to beXestablished,XXX he said. XXXDo you care to take the witness?XXXXXThe principal seemed to hesitate. XXXNo, Mr. Bacon,XXX he said at last.XXXXYouXXXre quite right--some things we can now accept as established.XXXXXSam might have considered himself dismissed, but he lingered.XXXXXIf thereXXXs anything else I can tell you----XXX he began; but theXsub-master shook his head.XXXXXNo; thatXXXll do for you, Parker,XXX he said curtly.XXSam, still very much in the fog of uncertainty and wondering greatlyXthat there should be any doubt of the TrojanXXXs claim to his book,Xturned away from the platform. As he did so, he caught ZornXXXs eye, andXwas reminded that that youth must have overheard all he had said.XWell, he didnXXXt care; it was all true--so Sam told himself, even asXa sense of resentment filled him. It wasnXXXt ZornXXXs affair; playingXeavesdropper was a contemptible trick. Sam amended his statement toXhimself: he did care; he objected strongly to ZornXXXs action. At theXfirst opportunity he would say so, forcefully and as publicly asXmight be. He glared at the other, who, truth to relate, returned theXattention in kind. Then, Sam had passed by and was taking his seat atXthe back of the hall.XXThe Trojan appeared to be in a brown study. His brow was furrowed, andXhe was gazing at the wall in the fixed fashion which suggests seeingXvery little. Jack Hagle had developed sudden absorption in his work,Xand was bent over the text-book on his desk. The Shark was still deepXin his calculation. Nobody else in the room, though, was ignoring, orXpretending to ignore, the peculiar affair which had interrupted theXstudy period.XXThe instructors had their heads together in a consultation whichXcontinued for several minutes. Then the principal and sub-master rose,Xand walked to the door; halted; exchanged a word or two.XXXXXWalker!XXX the sub-master called, and the Trojan, his manner ofXperplexity remaining, again went forward. This time he did not returnXto his seat, but followed the two men into the corridor.XXThe pupils left in the hall exchanged questioning glances. Every boyXthere--with the exception of the Shark--felt that something out of theXusual run was happening; and most of the number, including Sam Parker,Xgroped vainly for the secret. Sam had a notion that Zorn, and perhapsXHagle, had clew to the mystery, and it is to be confessed that theXsuspicion annoyed him. Therefore he awaited eagerly the reappearance ofXthe Trojan.XXBut Trojan Walker did not come back to the hall.XXA gong clanged, marking the end of the period. Sam and the othersXgathered up their books, and streamed out into the corridor, thereXdividing and going on to their own rooms. In each of these there wasXthe stir of preparation for home-going, for the period closed the dayXXXsXwork; then came the little pause, while the rows of boys and girls satXquietly, awaiting the dismissal signal. Sam noted that Trojan was notXin his accustomed place; but hardly had he made sure of this when theXgong clanged again, and the school session was over.XXSam marched out with his classmates, but lingered in the yard. So, asXit chanced, did a dozen other boys, among them several of his specialXchums. There was the Shark, blinking behind his big spectacles. ThereXwas XXXStepXXX Jones, so called because in height, and thinness, andXangularity he suggested a stepladder. There was XXXPokeXXX Green, who wasXso plump that a finger could be poked into him anywhere. There was TomXOrkney, sturdy, reserved, not an ingratiating fellow but sound to theXcore on better acquaintance. And, finally, there was Herman Boyd, longXa member of the clan and possibly the TrojanXXXs most intimate friend.XThese boys grouped themselves about Sam as about a leader, and waited,Xas he waited, for the coming of Trojan Walker.XXXXXSomething queer is on,XXX Sam told them. XXXI donXXXt know what it is, butXIXXXm going to find out. All I know so far is this.XXX And he sketchedXrapidly the incidents of the mastersXXX visit to the hall.XXThere was a murmur of surprise, followed by many questions. Sam shookXhis head.XXXXXSomehow TrojanXXXs Cicero is mixed up in it--how, I canXXXt guess,XXX saidXhe. XXXI knew the book as soon as I saw it. Every one of the crowd wouldXknow it on sight.XXXXXXXXThatXXXs right,XXX Step agreed. XXXIXXXve borrowed it a hundred times--got theXbest lot of written-in notes that ever happened--regular life saverXsometimes. Yes, IXXXd know that bully old book as far as I could see it.XXXXXXXXSame here!XXX said Poke Green; then turned to the Shark.XXXXXLook here, old polyhedron, you were in the hall--whatXXXs your theory?XWhatXXXs all the row about?XXXXXXXXNo theory,XXX said the Shark calmly. XXXWasnXXXt noticing--had somethingXbetter to do.XXXXXXXXWhat?XXXXXThe Shark shrugged. XXXI could tell you in thirty seconds, but youXcouldnXXXt understand in thirty years.XXXXXXXXI believe you!XXX chuckled Poke cheerfully.XXZorn, who had drawn near the group, laughed cynically.XXXXXHo, ho! If IXXXm not mistaken, you fellows will hear something prettyXsoon that you canXXXt help understanding in three seconds instead ofXthirty. And you wonXXXt like it, at that!XXXXXThe friends stared at him; finally Step spoke:XXXXXWhat is it weXXXre not going to like?XXXXXXXXWait and see.XXXXXXXXRats!XXX said Step scornfully.XXZorn scowled. XXXYour gang has been putting on a lot of side lately, butXyou wonXXXt feel so high and mighty after this.XXXXXXXXHow do you know we wonXXXt?XXX It was the Shark who put the query, though,Xas a rule, he took small part in such verbal clashes.XXXXXHow--how do I know?XXX Zorn appeared to be staggered by the demand.XSuddenly, however, his expression changed, and he pointed to a figureXframed by the arch of the great doorway.XXXXXThere he is! Let him do the talking for a while.XXXXXThe Trojan slowly descended the steps. His face was pale; he movedXheavily.XXSam met him and caught his arm.XXXXXWhatXXXs the row?XXX he asked eagerly.XXThe Trojan hesitated. XXXI--I--thereXXXs a mistake, a mix-up, somehow.XItXXXs over my Cicero. They--somebody, that is--found it in the desk IXsat at when we had the test the other day. Or they say that was whereXthey found it. And the way the thing worked out--that was the worstXof it--made me look as if I were lying about it. They began by askingXwhere my Cicero was, and I said I supposed it was with the rest of myXbooks. I thought it was; I hadnXXXt missed it--you know weXXXve had noXLatin recitation since the test. Then they sent me back to my seat,Xand--andXXX--he hesitated again, glancing almost apologetically atXSam--XXXand when they afterward took me to the principalXXXs office, theyXsaid they had evidence identifying the book as mine. They hadnXXXt shownXit to me before then. If they had, IXXXd have claimed it, of course, noXmatter how they happened to get hold of it. But the way everythingXhappened, you see, seemed to make it a pretty black case againstXme--lugging a text-book into an examination, and then trying to lieXout of it, and----XXXXXStep broke in hotly. XXXYou say somebody identified the book as yours?XWho was mean enough to do that?XXXXXOnce more Zorn laughed, and it was a taunting laugh. XXXHo, ho! DonXXXt askXWalker that! Get it first-hand!XXXXXTom OrkneyXXXs hand fell on his shoulder, and Tom spoke sternly:XXXXXYouXXXre aching to make trouble, somehow--anybody can see that. Cut itXout! This isnXXXt your row, unless youXXXre the telltale--understand?XXXXXZorn wriggled free. He retreated a pace or two; for OrkneyXXXs hand hadXbeen heavy.XXXXXYouXXXre a nice crowd!XXX he sneered. XXXThey say you call yourselves theXSafety First Club. Good name, that! Sure it is! Just fits in with theXspeed Sam Parker made in saving himself and giving Walker away. SafetyXFirst! You bet thatXXXs the rule with every one of you, and the rest canXgo hang, for all you care!XXXXXOrkney would have charged the enemy, but Sam held him back. The lastXminute or two had been a trying time for Parker, as any time must beXwhich brings revelation that one has fallen into a most embarrassingXpredicament. Sam had had his flash of illumination. He saw, allXtoo distinctly, the complications in which he had become involved.XInnocently enough he had fallen into the rXXle of chief witness againstXhis friend and club-mate. And Zorn had not played eavesdropper withoutXresult. That the knowledge thus gained would be used for the annoyanceXand discomfiture of the clan, Sam had no doubt; but he realized that aXfight then and there would in no wise mend matters.XXXXXEasy there, Tom, easy!XXX he counseled. XXXWe wonXXXt have any scrappingXjust now.XXXXXOrkney yielded, reluctantly.XXXXXMight as well let me polish him off,XXX he grumbled. XXXItXXXll have to beXdone sooner or later.XXXXXXXXVery likely--but better not now,XXX said Sam quietly.XXXXXSure! Always Safety First!XXX jeered Zorn; and walked away, grinningXwryly.XXXXXCHAPTER II THE SAFETY FIRST CLUBXXXThe Safety First Club, to which Zorn had alluded so cynically, bore itsXname for what its members regarded as good and sufficient reasons.XXThe club had come into existence in the most natural fashionXimaginable. That is, a little group of boys who liked one anotherXhad gathered about Sam Parker, had reached a simple but effectiveXorganization, and had been permitted to take possession of an unusedXstable on the premises of Step JonesXXXs father. This they had fittedXup as headquarters, furnishing the place as best they might. ThenXhad happened a series of incidents, of adventures and misadventures,Xwhich had served to impress upon the chums the penalties life exactsXfor heedlessness and carelessness. They had woefully misjudged TomXOrkney, for example--Tom, it may be explained, was not of the originalXband--and before they came to understanding of the sterling qualitiesXwhich eventually won him an election to the club, they had undergoneXexperiences well calculated to drive home the lesson of the danger inXoverhasty thought or action.XXNow, it is not to be understood that old heads had been put upon youngXshoulders. The boys still conducted themselves as healthy, active,Xwell meaning but fallible lads of seventeen or thereabouts, and not asXworld-worn philosophers of seventy-one. They made mistakes--lots ofXmistakes. They formed their judgments not on great knowledge but onXsuch knowledge as they had--and when a blunder was made, they tried notXto repeat it. And they strove to play the game fairly. Doubtless youXknow a dozen boys like these, and fancy them not the less because youXfind them very human.XXSam Parker had put into effect the guiding rule of the club in avertingXhostilities between Orkney and Edward Zorn, but he had by no meansXavoided the complications growing out of the affair of Trojan WalkerXXXsXCicero.XXThe Trojan himself was in serious trouble. Sentence had not yet beenXpassed in his case, but apparently he stood convicted of violating theXrule against taking text-books into rooms where examinations were held,Xand of committing the still graver offense of XXXtrying to lie out ofXit,XXX as the school phrase ran.XXSam seemed to be likely to fall heir to the unhappy reputation ofXbeing the chief witness against his friend. The story spread rapidly.XHe could observe its effects when he went to school the next morning.XA group of girls fell to whispering as he approached them, and drewXaside as he passed; some of the boys nodded stiffly. There was a loudXcontroversy in a corner of the yard, which quieted of a sudden, when heXcame near. Step, very red of face, said something in a low tone to theXyouth with whom he had been disputing, and joined Sam, slipping an armXthrough his and drawing him away.XXXXXConfound a chump, anyway!XXX he growled. XXXBut I say, Sam! Got anythingXon for this afternoon? LetXXXs take a hike somewhere.XXXXXSam suffered himself to be led out of earshot of the others. Then heXspoke crisply:XXXXXWhatXXXs the row? Talking about me, are they?XXXXXStep tried to avoid the question.XXXXXThere are a lot of idiots in this school. They run away with any foolXyarn, or let it run away with them, and----XXXXXXXXAnd the yarn this time is about me--about Trojan and me, that is?XXXXXXXXWhy--why, Sam----XXXXXXXXYes or no, Step?XXXXXXXXWell, yes; if you must have it. But I tell you, I put a flea in thatXfellowXXXs ear.XXXXXSam shook his head doubtfully. He was reminded, quaintly, that a fleaXwas a creature of remarkable agility, and he could not but suspect thatXthis flea supplied by the impulsive Step might hop about very busily inXthe next few days.XXXXXI guess it would be better not to do much talking for a while,XXX heXsaid soberly.XXXXXWhat! YouXXXd let all the yapping go on, and say nothing?XXXXXXXXIXXXd say as little as I could.XXXXXStep stared at Sam. XXXGreat Scott! If we donXXXt deny it, everybody willXbelieve itXXXs all so!XXXXXXXXWell, deny it, then, and stop there.XXXXXStep whistled softly. XXXWhe-e-e! Sam, I reckon you donXXXt know all theXtrimmings the story is getting. ItXXXs an awful thing for you and for theXwhole club.XXXXXXXXI see that,XXX said Sam. XXXWhat hits any one of a crowd like ours hitsXthe whole bunch. ThatXXXs the worst of it.XXXXXXXXBut canXXXt we do anything?XXX Step demanded impatiently.XXSamXXXs eyes flashed. There were several things he would have been veryXglad to do--violent things, some of them. But in the last few months heXhad learned steadying lessons in the value of self-control. Perhaps itXwas because he had learned these lessons more thoroughly than had anyXof his mates that he remained the guiding spirit of the club.XXXXXThe first thing to do is to keep our heads. The next is to wait to seeXjust what happens.... Hold on there, Step! DonXXXt think IXXXm for lyingXdown and letting everybody trample on us! IXXXll fight, and try to fightXas hard as any of the rest of you--when the time comes. But I think itXhasnXXXt come yet.XXXXXStep shrugged his shoulders. XXXWell, if thatXXXs your notion, all right.XI donXXXt believe thereXXXs another fellow in Plainfield who could put itXthrough, but maybe you can.XXXXXXXXWait and see,XXX said Sam very gravely.XXThe morning session gave plenty of evidence of the spread of the storyXthrough the Junior class, and, indeed, through the school. Sam wasXperfectly conscious of a cooling in the regard in which he was held. AtXrecess the club rallied about him, but other classmates shunned him. ItXwas at recess, too, that the Trojan heard his fate. He came out of theXprincipalXXXs office, after a five-minute conference, looking as dejectedXas a boy in physical health could look.XXXXXI get zero on the Latin paper--a clean flunk--to begin with,XXX heXreported. XXXThatXXXs on a charge of taking a book into the examination.XThen IXXXm laid off, as far as Cicero goes, for the rest of the term.XThat is on the charge that I tried to squirrel out of the fix and liedXabout the book.XXXXXXXXBut thatXXXs a half suspension!XXXXXXXXHowXXXll you keep up?XXXXXXXXWhere does it leave your standing now?XXXXXXXXWouldnXXXt they give you a chance to defend yourself?XXXXXThere was a medley of exclamations and questions. The Trojan madeXanswer in general:XXXXXI donXXXt know just how it will work out. I donXXXt know what IXXXm going toXdo.XXXXXXXXBut you canXXXt drop out!XXX cried Step hotly.XXThe Trojan smiled, but the smile had no mirth in it.XXXXXYou canXXXt tell what you can do, Step, till you try,XXX he said.XXXXXBut it would break up the crowd--the club! WeXXXve been together, andXweXXXve stuck together since I donXXXt remember when. And weXXXve been in theXsame class, and weXXXve all kept traveling along together through schoolXand----XXXXXXXXI know all that,XXX the Trojan interrupted.XXThe Shark was moved to speech. XXXLook here, Trojan! Tell me something.XThey say they found your Cicero where it had no business to be--whoXfound it?XXXXXXXXOne of the Freshmen, I think.XXXXXXXXWhich one?XXXXXXXXI donXXXt know.XXXXXThe Shark snorted. XXXHuh! Find out!XXXXXXXXWhat difference does it make?XXX asked the Trojan dully.XXXXXAll the difference!XXX snapped the Shark. XXXProblem, isnXXXt it? Course itXis! How you going to solve it till you have facts to work on?XXXXXXXXI meant that so long as the book was found in a desk in theXexamination room, it didnXXXt matter who found it. The Freshman, whoeverXit was, gave it to the teacher in charge there.XXXXXXXXKid trick!XXX Step put in.XXXXXOh, a yearling wouldnXXXt know any better,XXX said Herman Boyd. XXXHeXwouldnXXXt intend any harm.XXXXXXXXWell, now, you canXXXt be too sure----XXX Poke began; but the SharkXbrought the talk back to the main question.XXXXXHow do you know, Trojan, it was found in the desk you used that day?XXXXXXXXHow? Why--why, I suppose it must have been.XXXXXXXXSuppose!XXX groaned the Shark. XXXCanXXXt you fellows ever learn to beXexact?XXXXXA little color came into the TrojanXXXs cheeks at the thrust. XXXBeXreasonable, Shark! If a brick fell from a chimney and hit you, wouldXyou--er--er--would you find out, first thing, how tall the chimney was?XThis--this whole business--well, it just took me off my feet.XXXXXXXXHuh! Guess it did. But IXXXve got my feet under me, and IXXXd like to getXthings straight. Now, tell me! WhatXXXs the last--the last thing youXXXreXabsolutely sure about--about the book, I mean?XXXXXXXXI left it in the corridor. Sam had borrowed it for a minute, butXhe gave it back. I had just time to look up a passage before theXbell rang. Then I left the Cicero with two or three other books IXhad--stacked XXXem against the wall, just as all the other fellows didXwith theirs. When we came out, after the examination, everybody was inXa rush to get away. I grabbed up my books. I didnXXXt stop to count XXXem.XI took it for granted all of them were there. And as weXXXve had no LatinXrecitation since then, it didnXXXt occur to me to look up my Cicero.XXXXXXXXSame case here--same to a dot!XXX testified Poke.XXXXXNothing to do with the case,XXX objected the Shark. XXXWeXXXre figuring onXthe TrojanXXXs row. And where did you sit, Trojan?XXXXXXXXIn the back row.XXXXXXXXSure of that?XXXXXXXXYes.XXXXXXXXI remember he was there,XXX Sam corroborated. XXXI was two rows in frontXof him.XXXXXXXXWhich desk did you have, Trojan?XXX the Shark persisted.XXXXXWhich? Why--why, one near the middle of the row.XXXXXXXXAble to point it out surely?XXXXXThe Trojan hesitated. XXXI--I guess so. Only I didnXXXt notice especially.XXXXXXXXUmph! Remember your neighbors?XXXXXThe Trojan wrinkled his brow. XXXLetXXXs see! None of our crowd was veryXnear me.XXXXXXXXWas Zorn?XXX Sam queried.XXXXXI think he was over to the left--two or three desks away.XXXXXXXXAnd Jack Hagle?XXXXXXXXYes, he was near me.XXXXXXXXHow near?XXX the Shark demanded.XXThe Trojan shook his head. XXXI canXXXt tell you that. Confound it! youXfellows seem to forget that I was trying to pass a Latin paper and notXmapping the room. I remember Hagle was somewhere around, and Zorn wasXnot very far off. Yes, and Sam was a couple of rows in front of me. ButXthat is all I can recall of what didnXXXt impress me especially at theXtime.XXXXXXXXUmph!XXX said the Shark, and made no further inquiry.XXHere the big gong clanged, and the pupils streamed back into theXschoolhouse, the Safety First Club members going with the others. SamXfelt a certain relief as he saw the Trojan taking his place in line:Xhe had had disquieting doubts about the course Walker might follow. AXfellow smarting under a sense of injustice--SamXXXs confidence in theXTrojanXXXs honesty was unshaken--might do something in haste which wouldXlead to deep repentance at leisure. But the Trojan went back to theXclassroom, and joined in the recitation almost in his usual manner. AsXit happened, the Latin hour had passed, so that the partial suspensionXdid not interfere with the work he had to do after recess.XXBeing far from blind, and, in fact, being especially keenly observantXthat day, Sam gathered more evidence of the spread of the story ofXthe TrojanXXXs trouble and his own share in bringing it about. Now andXthen he met glances which were frankly unfriendly: when the divisionsXchanged rooms between periods he made note that some of the girls,Xpassing him in the corridors, took pains to keep as far from him asXpossible. It was not a pleasant experience for the boy; but for theXpresent, at least, there was nothing he could do but grit his teeth andXkeep his temper.XXSamXXXs lessons in self-discipline stood him in good stead. They helpedXhim study his problem, while he resisted temptation to rage against hisXfate.XXEd Zorn must have been extremely busy in circulating his version ofXwhat had occurred in the hall.XXThat was, to SamXXXs mind, a big, outstanding fact. Only Zorn had beenXnear enough to overhear his testimony. The principal and the sub-masterXwould not have spread the story; therefore, ZornXXXs responsibility wasXhardly matter for argument.XXWhy, though, should he have displayed such zeal in making the affairXpublic property?XXSam shook his head over this question. Zorn was no friend of theXSafety First Club; but something more than mere lack of liking wasXneeded fully to explain his conduct. It was still a puzzle to Sam, whenXthe session came to an end, and school was dismissed for the day.XXWhen the Trojan came down the steps, Sam was waiting for him. TheyXwalked away together, both keeping silence until they had left theXyard. Then, as they turned into a quiet side street, Sam spoke.XXXXXTrojan, thereXXXs just one thing I want you to understand. If IXXXdXdreamed I was getting you into this fix, they couldnXXXt have pried aXword out of me.XXXXXXXXI know that, Sam,XXX said the other, evenly.XXXXXBut I did get you into it. Somehow, the way things happened, IXcouldnXXXt have done more harm if IXXXd schemed a week! That part of itXXXsXup to me, all right!XXXXXThe Trojan kept his eyes straight before him. XXXOh, IXXXm not blamingXyou,XXX he said. XXXWhatXXXd be the use? WhatXXXs the use now of--of anything?XXXXXXXXHere, drop that talk!XXX Sam counseled. XXXKeep a stiff upper lip! See youXdonXXXt get rattled!XXXXXThe Trojan stopped short. He turned to his comrade.XXXXXRattled!XXX he cried. XXXSam, you know what theyXXXve done to me? It isXpractically throwing me out of the class! My term marks in Latin areXsmashed. Pretty chance IXXXd have to keep up the work outside, even ifXtheyXXXd let me take the final examination! And a clean flunk in LatinXwould put me down and out. IXXXd better quit altogether. IXXXve beenXthinking it over. I donXXXt see anything else to do.XXXXXXXXItXXXs the one thing you canXXXt do--you shanXXXt do!XXX Sam protested.XXThe TrojanXXXs manner changed; he spoke dully but with a sort ofXdetermination.XXXXXIXXXve thought it out, I say. You know my case--the case at home, IXmean.XXXXXSam nodded. TrojanXXXs father, a traveling salesman, was away on a longXtrip through the West; his mother was a semi-invalid, quite incapableXof coming to her sonXXXs assistance in an emergency like this.XXXXXDropping outXXXd be the simplest and the best,XXX Walker went on. XXXI guessXthere are other schools--if there arenXXXt any to take me, I can go toXwork somewhere.XXXXXXXXNonsense! You stay here!XXXXXXXXI wonXXXt. This is my own affair--IXXXve got to settle it for myself.XXXXThen his voice rose. XXXSam, they didnXXXt give me a square deal! It wasnXXXtXfair! They trapped me; they caught me by a trick! I wonXXXt stand it! IXXXmXthrough with them--I want to be through with anybody thatXXXll treat meXas IXXXve been treated!XXXXXSam stared at him in perplexity. The old Trojan had been easy going,Xgood natured, a fellow who preferred compromise; the new Trojan wasXcuriously grim and determined and unyielding. There was a glint in hisXeye Sam had never seen there before; his jaw was set stubbornly. TheXTrojan was in earnest, in deadly earnest. Sam realized this, and hisXheart sank within him. Nevertheless, he was ready to fight manfully.XXXXXYouXXXre all wrong! It wasnXXXt a square deal--IXXXm with you there. But IXXXmXnot sure that wasnXXXt accidental--the way it happened, I mean. ThereXXXsXsomething else, though--you canXXXt go ahead as if nobody but yourselfXwas hit.XXXXXXXXOh! CanXXXt I?XXX growled the Trojan.XXXXXYou canXXXt, because weXXXre all in the row. IXXXm in up to my neck; thereXisnXXXt a fellow in the club who doesnXXXt feel that itXXXs his fight as wellXas yours and mine.XXXXXXXXItXXXs all right to say that, only you canXXXt prove it.XXXXXXXXWhy--why----XXX Sam began; but he was to be spared the need of makingXhis argument.XXAround the corner, from the direction of the school, came Poke, walkingXfast and dabbing at his face with a handkerchief. At sight of theXothers he pulled up; gave a gasp; betrayed symptoms of a desire to turnXand retreat; hesitated; reached decision; strode forward, grinningXmost unconvincingly. Beneath one of his eyes the flesh was bruised andXreddened.XXXXXWhatXXXs the matter?XXX Sam demanded sharply.XXThe grin on PokeXXXs usually placid countenance was maintained by patentXeffort.XXXXXOh, nothing! Just a--no; nothingXXXs the matter.XXXXXXXXWho blacked your eye?XXXXXXXXXXXTisnXXXt blacked.XXXXXXXXItXXXll be black enough in an hour or two. Who smashed you?XXXXXPokeXXXs glance went from Sam to the Trojan, but returned swiftly, and aXbit appealingly, to the chief of the Safety First Club.XXXXXItXXXs nothing, I tell you. CanXXXt a fellow do anything without yourXholding him up?XXXXXXXXThat depends. When it comes to getting black eyes----XXXXXXXXOh, that was just a--a bump that came my way,XXX Poke put in hastily.XXXXNot worth mentioning. And say! IXXXm in a hurry, Sam. CanXXXt stop to talkXto you fellows. XXXBy!XXXXXSo speaking, Poke stepped by his friends, taking care to keep out ofXarmXXXs reach, and hurried along the street.XXThe others did not pursue him. Sam looked at the Trojan, and the TrojanXmet his gaze unhappily.XXXXXYou know what that means?XXX Sam asked with a touch of sternness.XXThe Trojan nodded. Poke Green, most peaceful of mortals, had been in aXfight; moreover, it was to be suspected that Poke neither had shunnedXnor now repented the combat.XXSam pressed his advantage. XXXIt means that what I told you is true: thatXthis thing brings in every fellow in the club. WeXXXre standing together;Xthe crowd is backing you, and itXXXll back me, for IXXXm going to needXfriends as you need XXXem. We canXXXt quit cold, either of us. WeXXXve got toXplay the game through, clear up this mess, and win out!XXXXXXXXHow can we win?XXXXXXXXI donXXXt know yet, but we will win, if it takes all summer.XXXXXXXXI donXXXt see whatXXXs to be done.XXXXXXXXGive me time--give the club time, that is.XXXXXThere was a little pause. Then said the Trojan, dejectedly:XXXXXItXXXll be no use. Still, if youXXXre so set about it, Sam--and I supposeXitXXXs only right to stand by the crowd, if itXXXs standing by me. But whatXdo you want me to do?XXXXXXXXPromise not to bolt till weXXXve had a chance to catch our breath. AndXpromise to let us know--give us fair warning--before you do anything.XXXXXThere was another pause.XXXXXSam,XXX said the Trojan at last, XXXSam, I--I guess IXXXll have to promiseXyou so much, anyway.XXXXXXXXCHAPTER III THE OPEN AIR TREATMENTXXXPlainfield High School, like most other schools, had its politics.XThere were, of course, the usual rivalries between the classes; thenXthere were the likes and dislikes of various groups in each class;Xthere was some sharp competition for honors in scholarship, and ratherXmore for the prizes of personal popularity and leadership. In fact,Xlife inside the school was a deal like life outside it, with theXsame mingling of the ambitious and the indifferent, the industriousXand the idle, the prudent and the venturesome, the schemers and theXhappy-go-lucky souls with never a thought for the morrow.XXTaken individually, the boys of the Safety First Club enjoyedXpopularity above the average, but as a crowd, or a clique, or anXorganization--whichever you prefer to call it--they had many critics.XFrankly, envy had much to do with this state of things. Other XXXgangsXXXXcame together, and flourished for a time, and fell apart: the clubXcontinued. Most boys are clannish by instinct, and here was a clanXwhich truly was a standing challenge to less successful organizers.XMoreover, it did not try to enlarge its membership; and here again wasXcause of grievance. There were a dozen juniors who would have prized anXinvitation to join the Safety Firsts above any reward in the gift ofXthe school. There were several who had made eager overtures to Sam andXhis allies without result; there were others who had sought entranceXto the charmed circle by war, so to speak. Oddly enough, the only oneXto succeed had been of these open enemies. In his day Tom Orkney hadXopposed the club bitterly, and so had borne his full share in bringingXabout complications, from which, as it chanced, nobody suffered soXgrievously as Tom himself. But the experience had enabled the clubXto put Orkney to the test. He had not been found wanting, and in theXend had gained his place in the clan by the very excellent process ofXearning it, which, after all, is perhaps the most satisfactory processXin the long run.XXSam Parker was under no illusions as to these conditions. He knew theXspeed with which gossip spreads. He understood perfectly the causesXwhich would prejudice judgment of the trouble in which the Trojan wasXinvolved, and in which he himself shared, and from which the otherXmembers of the club could not escape wholly. The club would standXtogether; therefore all the club must feel the effects of the scandal.XAnd Sam, as the head of the club, must justify his leadership.XXA year earlier in such a case he might have consulted his father, butXnow he was bent on working out his problem for himself. Self-relianceXwas a quality he was trying to develop, and Mr. Parker approvedXthis policy. So Sam, parting at last from the Trojan, went home inXthoughtful mood; found that he was late for dinner, and sat himselfXdown at the table to dine alone under the critical eye of Maggie, theXmaid, a very good friend of his, by the way, but by no means blinded byXpartiality to his shortcomings.XXSam ate mechanically but with good appetite. He cleared his plate.XXXXXWant some more meat?XXX Maggie asked curtly.XXXXXWhy--whyXXX--he was thinking of anything but his food--XXXwhy--why, IXguess--not. No, thank you.XXXXXMaggie sniffed skeptically. Moreover, she picked up his plate,Xdisappeared for a moment in the kitchen, returned with a secondXgenerous portion.XXXXXEat that--guess youXXXll need it soon enough!XXX she remarked.XXSam looked up. XXXEr--er--what do you mean, Maggie?XXXXXXXXYou donXXXt need telling.... Take your time, though--donXXXt gobble!XXXXXSam meekly obeyed. XXXOh, all right. IXXXve got lots of time. I--I mustXhave been thinking about something else.XXXXXMaggieXXXs lip curled. XXXThat ainXXXt what IXXXd call a secret, exactly. AXblind man could see you were wool-gathering.... What scrape you in now?XXXXXXXXOh, noth--nothing in particular.XXXXXXXXUmph! They never are, by your tell.XXXXXSam, failing to find satisfactory response, made none, and devoted hisXefforts to his knife and fork. Maggie set her arms akimbo, and surveyedXhim grimly.XXXXXWell, I must say thereXXXs one comfort: you donXXXt take out your spite onXyour victuals.... But how bad is it?XXXXXXXXItXXXs--er--er--itXXXs no killing matter.XXXXXXXXWhat are you worrying so for, then?XXXXXXXXIXXXm not worrying!XXXXXMaggie smiled oddly. XXXWell, I do declare! Sam Parker, itXXXs the firstXtime I ever knew you to be practising to be a play actor!XXXXXSam wriggled. XXXOh, quit your joshing! IXXXm bothered about--aboutXsomething. IXXXve got to figure out what to do--thatXXXs all.XXXXXXXXWant any help?XXXXXXXXNo--no, thank you.XXXXXXXXUmph! Maybe youXXXd like some pudding, then?XXXXXXXXNo, thank you,XXX Sam repeated, and pushed back his chair.XXXXXBetter think twice about it,XXX Maggie urged. XXXItXXXll be a long timeXbefore supper.XXXXXSam snatched up his cap, and hurried out, calling back a third XXXNo,Xthank you,XXX over his shoulder.XXThere was a big, old-fashioned barn on the Parker place, part of whichXwas now in use as a garage. Just outside its wide door stood a touringXcar, the cover of its hood raised. A clean-shaven man in overalls, whoXhad been pottering about the motor, caught sight of Sam, and hailed himXcheerily:XXXXXHi there! WhereXXXs the fire?XXXXXSam pulled up. XXXFire? What are you talking about, Lon? I havenXXXt heardXany alarm.XXXXXLon Gates, man-of-all-work, coachman, gardener, chauffeur, and generalXfactotum, chuckled. He studied Sam for a moment. They were greatXfriends, were these two, and more than once the man had proved a towerXof strength for the boy in time of trouble.XXXXXNo fire, eh? Thought you must be goinXXX to one, way you was speedinXXX.XXXXXXXXWell, I wasnXXXt.XXXXXXXXSo?XXX Lon appeared to reflect briefly. XXXHuh! Then you must XXXaXXX beenXlike a feller I seen goinXXX over a dam one freshet time--lots oXXX hurryXand no special intention.XXXXXXXXWhat happened to him?XXXXXLon shook his head. XXXDunno. Guess he got out of it all right, somehow.XTurns out that way now and then.XXXXXXXXGlad to hear it,XXX said Sam.XXAgain Lon surveyed his youthful friend. XXXHuh! Something botherinXXX you,Xeh?XXXXXXXXYes--bothering me a lot.XXXXXThere was a pause. Lon, perceiving that Sam was not disposed to explainXhis trouble, respected his reticence, and asked no questions.XXXXXGuess, mebbe, I made a mistake to stop you,XXX he remarked at last. XXXOldXDr. Shanksmare cures a heap oXXX misery--him and his open air treatment.XFeelinXXX as you do, guess you might as well run along.XXXXXBut Sam, having been halted, seemed to be in no haste.XXXXXHang it! thereXXXs nowhere to go,XXX he complained.XXXXXWhatXXXs the matter with goinXXX swimminXXX?XXXXXXXXToo cold yet.XXXXXXXXTry a hike, then.XXXXXXXXToo hot.XXXXXLon laid down the wrench with which he had been working; he made quiteXa ceremony of wiping his hands on a bunch of waste.XXXXXSam, you kinder remind me oXXX the old lady with the plate oXXXXhalf-melted ice-cream--she said it was too soft to eat and too hardXto drink. Yet it was pooty good ice-cream, at that; soXXXs this a pootyXgood spring day, if only youXXXll take it right. And so longXXXs youXainXXXt feelinXXX moved to sob out the sorrows oXXX your young life on thisXsympathizinXXX bosom, why donXXXt you walk XXXem off? Get your crowd. GoXsomewhere. See something.XXXXXXXXWhat is there to see?XXXXXXXXThat depends a lot on your eyes.XXXXXXXXWhat do you mean?XXXXXXXXI mean thereXXXs a heap of difference between keepinXXX your eyes shut andXhavinXXX XXXem open and lookinXXX for new things.XXXXXXXXWhatXXXs new in this old town?XXXXXLon took thought. XXXThereXXXs Crescent lake, for one thing.XXXXXXXXCrescent lake?XXXXXXXXYep. ThatXXXs the new name. Used to be MudgettXXXs pond. Then some oXXXXthe folks got to readinXXX poetry, and tried to call it Half-Moon. NowXthereXXXs a syndicate openinXXX it up, puttinXXX in roads, and sellinXXX sitesXfor cottages and camps. And itXXXs Crescent lake on the advertisements.XXXXXSam was not enthusiastic. XXXThat doesnXXXt sound very exciting, Lon,XXX heXobserved.XXXXXGives you something to see, though. TheyXXXre goinXXX to have a good dealXof a place, one way and another--dancinXXX pavilion, roller skatinXXX rink,XswimminXXX beach, all the regXXXlation didoes. Got most oXXX the buildinXXXXdone now. Why donXXXt you round up your pals and tramp out to have a lookXat things?XXXXXXXXH-m-m!XXX SamXXXs enthusiasm did not increase.XXXXXOld MudgettXXXs pond used to be fine for fishinXXX,XXX Lon went on. XXXNatXXXralXpickerel ground at the lower end--lily pads--lots of XXXem. Then at theXupper end there was plenty oXXX deep water and rocks for bass. And IXguess the new artificial attractions ainXXXt interfered with that partXof it. And what with the woodsy shores--say, Sam, thereXXXs a heap wussXspots than Crescent lake, nay MudgettXXXs pond, as the fashionable folksXwould say.XXXXXXXXXXXNayXXX?XXX Sam repeated doubtfully.XXXXXYea--nay!XXX Lon chuckled. XXXGettinXXX too proud of your Latin to recognizeXyour old French friends when you meet XXXem? Or mebbe youXXXre used toXcallinXXX that special old crony XXXknee.XXXXXXXXSam laughed. XXXIXXXm afraid to say just what I might call it. But IXdidnXXXt know, Lon, that you were such a linguist.XXXXXXXXOh, IXXXm like old Peter Hunker, buyinXXX a new slate for his boy. XXXGiveXme the best ten-cent slate you got in the store,XXX says Peter to theXclerk. XXXI believe in a liberal eddication.XXX And thatXXXs jest my case,XSam. And believinXXX in beinXXX liberal with it, I spend my French sameXXXsXmy English--get the idee?XXXXXXXXYes,XXX said Sam, XXXI grasp it.XXXXXLon picked up his wrench, and began to busy himself with the motor.XXXXXThink youXXXll take a dose oXXX Dr. ShanksmareXXXs medicine?XXX he inquired.XXSam meditated briefly. A long walk with his chums would giveXopportunity to discuss the case of the Trojan, his own predicament,Xand the plight of the club. And even a nominal purpose in a tramp wasXbetter than aimless wandering. He felt no burning curiosity about theXimprovements at Crescent lake, but was willing enough to look themXover. Still, the lake was seven or eight miles from town. He mentionedXthe circumstance, and Lon responded promptly:XXXXXThatXXXs all right--jest distance enough. And IXXXll see that you donXXXtXhave to walk back. HowXXXs that? Simple enough. IXXXve got to take aXpackage for your Ma out to MisXXX Haskins at the Ridge, and cominXXX back,XIXXXll swing round by the foot oXXX the lake and pick you up. ThatXXXll beXXXXlong about half-past five. The carXXXs big enough to load all yourXcrowd, and IXXXll have the lot oXXX you home in time for supper. What say?XXXXXSam reached decision. XXXI say yes. IXXXll telephone to the fellows, and ifXtheyXXXll join in, weXXXll make the hike.XXXXXXXXNow youXXXre talkinXXX sense,XXX quoth Lon heartily.XXXXXOh, I guess the scheme is all right.XXXXXXXXOf course it is,XXX Lon encouraged. XXXItXXXll do you good to stretch yourXlegs, and mebbe youXXXll manage to do a stroke oXXX business, somehow. YouXnever can tell, Sam, whatXXXs waitinXXX for you round the next turn in theXroad.XXXXXXXXI guess thatXXXs so,XXX Sam admitted.XXXXXSure it is!XXX said Lon with conviction. XXXThatXXXs what makes travelinXXXXthe roads worth while, sonny!XXXXXXXXCHAPTER IV THE CLUB AT THE COUNCIL ROCKXXXOf the club there responded to SamXXXs call Poke and Step, the Shark,XTom Orkney and Herman Boyd. The Trojan was not at home. On the whole,XSam did not regret the fact that Walker was not to be with them thatXafternoon: certain matters of common concern could be talked over moreXfreely in his absence.XXPokeXXXs marks of combat were not to be hidden. The bruised flesh beneathXhis eye was beginning to show a prismatic variety of coloring, in spiteXof the application of several remedies in favor among the youth of theXtown; but Sam did not fail to observe that the other boys were carefulXto maintain an air of noticing nothing out of the common in PokeXXXsXappearance. It was significant testimony to the serious view theyXtook of the whole affair. Even a black eye was not matter for jest.XPresently, no doubt, Poke would tell the story; but until he choseXto speak, his silence would be respected. Boys, as a rule, are notXcredited with a high degree of consideration, but at times can displayXa restraint which many of their elders would find it hard to equal.XXOn the march Sam managed to have a few confidential words with each ofXhis companions, acquainting them with the TrojanXXXs promise to take noXhasty step. He was gratified to find in each case strong approval ofXthis decision, and just as strong desire to do anything possible toXuphold the good name of the club and all its members.XXXXXYou tell us whatXXXs the program, Sam, and weXXXll stand by youXXX--that wasXthe way Orkney put it, and the speech fairly represented the spirit ofXall the party.XXA seven-mile tramp, of a fine day, is really play for healthyXschoolboys. The club thought nothing of it. Sam felt his spiritsXrising, and began to be glad that he had accepted LonXXXs counsel. HeXcould even join heartily in a discussion of short cuts, and finallyXcarry the decision in favor of the one he approved, which followed aXwoods road, and then a mere path. The country about the lake was thinlyXsettled, with many wooded tracts, a few swampy patches, and a numberXof low ridges, from the top of the last of which Step was the first toXcatch sight of the shining blue of the water. The marchers streamedXdown the slope, and out upon a little promontory, pleasantly shaded byXbig trees and with a great rock almost at its tip.XXThere was a chorus of exclamations. XXXBully place!XXX XXXSay, weXXXve hit theXreal beauty spot!XXX XXXWhat a camp site this would be, eh?XXX XXXHowXXXd happenXwe never came here before? Looks like a crackerjack of a pond!XXXXXSam advanced to the waterXXXs edge, and glanced up and down the lake.XA sound of hammering from the opposite shore helped him to discoverXthe new pavilion, taking shape in a grove nearly half a mile away; heXcould make out the lines of the framework and the half-hidden smallerXbuildings, flanking it and already completed.XXXXXGuess we missed the road,XXX he said. XXXOught to have taken that lastXturn to the right instead of the one to the left.XXXXXXXXWhatXXXs the difference?XXX Step demanded. XXXIXXXll bet weXXXve found theXprettiest place on the shore.XXXXXPoke had been exploring the outcropping ledge.XXXXXLook here, you fellows!XXX he shouted. XXXSay, this is the finest oldXcouncil rock you ever set eyes on!XXXXXThe others joined him. On its side toward the water the mass of stoneXwas hollowed out in a sort of half bowl or natural amphitheatre on aXsmall scale. There was room for a score of boys, and the irregularitiesXin the surface of the rock offered bench-like seats. Poke settledXhimself with an air of triumph in spite of his battered appearance.XXXXXSit down, everybody!XXX he suggested. XXXLetXXXs be comfortable, and talk itXover.XXXXXOrkney glanced at PokeXXXs discolored countenance.XXXXXIf the time to talk has come, youXXXd better begin,XXX he said pointedly.XXXXIXXXd like to know just how you came by that shiner.XXXXXXXXGuess, canXXXt you?XXX Poke queried.XXXXXYes, but I want the facts.XXXXXThere was a murmur of agreement. XXXGo to it!XXX Step urged.XXXXXWell, I met a fellow and he said something----XXX Poke began.XXXXXWho was he, and what did he say?XXX Herman Boyd interposed.XXPoke hesitated, then reached decision. XXXHe--it was XXXScrubXXX Payne. HeXgot to roughing me about--well, about things--our putting on side butXnot hanging together in a pinch--rot like that, you know!XXXXXXXXJust what did he say?XXX Sam asked sharply.XXPoke straightened his shoulders. XXXWell--if you must have it--he saidXthat the Trojan tried to lie out of taking a book into examination, andXthat he might have got away with it, if Sam hadnXXXt thrown him down.XThen I called him a liar, of course. And--and thatXXXs about all.XXXXXThere was a very brief silence. Tom Orkney ended it.XXXXXScrub Payne, eh?XXX He repeated the name softly, lingeringly. XXXScrubXPayne? Twice your height, almost--XXXbout weigh in in my class,XPoke--yes, yes. And spreading that story, was he?XXXXXSam raised a hand. XXXListen, Tom! Listen, all you fellows! We might asXwell understand that thatXXXs the yarn the whole school has had. AndXhammering up three or four who talk out loud wonXXXt disprove it.... WaitXa minute, Step! Let me finish. IXXXve got a score or two to settle, butXthis isnXXXt the time to do it. ItXXXs perfectly clear Ed Zorn is at theXbottom of the trouble--heXXXs the only one who heard what was said inXthe hall. HeXXXs been busy, making mischief. Some day IXXXll try to attendXto him, but thereXXXs somebody else to think of first, and thatXXXs theXTrojan. WhatXXXs to be done about him, and for him? HeXXXs agreed not toXmake a bolt without letting us know, but it seems to me itXXXs up to usXto fix things so heXXXll be willing to stay.XXXXXXXXSay, thatXXXs going to be a contract!XXX Step exclaimed.XXThe others nodded agreement.XXXXXItXXXs the Latin thatXXXs the facer--outside of his feelings,XXX saidXHerman Boyd gravely. XXXHeXXXll be flunked, if he canXXXt go to recitations,Xespecially with a zero mark for the test to pull down his term stand.XXXXXThe Shark was scowling behind his spectacles. XXXLetXXXs do some figuring,XXXXhe suggested. XXXHow were his marks up to this mix-up?XXXXXXXXOh, fair--along in the eighties,XXX said Herman.XXXXXWhat do you mean by XXXalongXXX?XXXXXXXXCall it eighty-five or eighty-six.XXXXXXXXHow much does a test count?XXXXXXXXAbout the same as a weekXXXs recitations,XXX said Herman, but Step offeredXXXXTen daysXXX almost simultaneously.XXThe SharkXXXs scowl increased. XXXThere you go! CanXXXt you fellows beXprecise about anything? Which is it?XXXXXThe club tried to agree on the point, but failed.XXXXXAnyway, the zero will pull him below seventy,XXX Herman declared.XSeventy being the passing mark, the faces of two or three of the clubXlengthened.XXXXXThen if he has to stay away from recitations, heXXXll have no chance toXincrease his mark,XXX groaned Step.XXXXXAnd what sort of a show will he have in the final examination?XXX PokeXput in.XXXXXNo show at all!XXX said the Shark promptly. XXXUmph! No need to take toXfiguring on that.XXXXXXXXHold on, fellows!XXX said Sam. XXXI donXXXt get light on the term-standXpart of it, but on the other--the final, I mean--well, thereXXXs a way.XXXXXXXXWhat way?XXX two or three demanded together.XXXXXWe can work with him afternoons--tutor him--keep him up with theXclass.XXXXXXXXGood scheme, Sam!XXX shouted Step.XXXXXFine! IXXXm for it!XXX added Herman.XXXXXSame here!XXX said Poke. XXXIXXXm no prodigy in Cicero, but IXXXm good andXwilling.XXXXXThere was evident revival of spirit in the clan.XXXXXIXXXll try to class with Poke,XXX Tom Orkney contributed gravely, butXhopefully.XXBut the Shark was shaking his head dubiously. XXXLetXXXs get this thingXstraight. We can tutor the Trojan--that is, you chaps can--I donXXXt goXmuch on this language foolishness myself. But if you do, will he beXallowed to take the final?XXXXXXXXWhy shouldnXXXt they let him?XXX Step asked hotly.XXXXXIXXXm after facts, not reasons one way or the other. WhatXXXs the fact?XXXXXXXXBut theyXXXll just have to!XXXXXXXXWhatXXXs the fact?XXX the Shark repeated inexorably.XXXXXI donXXXt know,XXX Sam confessed, as the others glanced at him inquiringly.XXXXXThen youXXXd better find out,XXX said the Shark simply.XXXXXHow?XXXXXXXXFrom headquarters. Ask the principal.XXXXXXXXOh!XXX said Sam. His tone was not blithe.XXXXXYouXXXve struck the right track, Shark!XXX Poke declared.XXXXXNo; IXXXm putting Sam on it,XXX the Shark corrected.XXThere are obligations in leadership as well as privileges. Sam acceptedXthe task set him by his followers.XXXXXThe Shark has the idea,XXX he said. XXXWe ought to know what is what,Xand I guess itXXXs up to me to do the asking. IXXXll attend to it. ButXthereXXXs another thing--we ought to agree--have an understanding amongXourselves--about what weXXXll do--with the crowd at school, you know.XWeXXXre going to have our fur rubbed the wrong way. ThereXXXll be a lotXof ugly talk. There has been some, as you know, but thereXXXll be more.XWeXXXre going to be a pretty unpopular bunch for a while--and how are weXgoing to take it?XXXXXXXXHead on!XXX cried Step. XXXGive XXXem as good as they send!XXXXXXXXThatXXXs the talk!XXX vowed Herman Boyd.XXThen Orkney intervened. XXXEasy there, fellows! LetXXXs have SamXXXs notion.XXXXXNow, Sam had done a deal of thinking about the case in all its aspects,Xand had tried to put to practical use some of the lessons he hadXlearned in the school of experience.XXXXXWell, as I see it,XXX he began, XXXthereXXXs only one way to settle thisXthing, and settle it right.XXXXXXXXBy punching a lot of heads!XXX Step urged.XXXXXNot a bit of it! Oh, I donXXXt mean that we mustnXXXt XXXtend to someXaccounts----XXXXXXXXRight! I know of one IXXXll look after,XXX said Orkney grimly.XXXXXIXXXve made a note of one, myself,XXX said Sam in quite the same manner.XXXXBut itXXXll have to wait, and so will yours, Tom. Something elseXcomes first, and thatXXXs disproving the charge that the Trojan liedXabout the book, and that I gave him away.... DonXXXt interrupt! Let meXfinish. The Trojan is innocent, and if he is innocent, there must beXsome way to prove it. I didnXXXt intentionally say a word to hurt him,Xand if we clear his record, mineXXXll be cleared, too. Somebody--notXthe Trojan--took that book into the examination, and left it in theXdesk where it was found. When we can show who did that, weXXXre far onXthe right road. They say murder will out, and if thatXXXs so, I guessXcrookedness will out, too. ItXXXs what weXXXve got to bank on, while weXwork as hard as we can to discover the truth and the whole truth. And,Xmeanwhile, we wonXXXt be helping anybody by fighting and making theXscandal worse than it is. Our job will be to keep our heads, and haveXour eyes and ears open, and tutor the Trojan.XXXXXXXXIf the principal will agree to let him take the final and to do theXsquare thing about term marks,XXX Poke supplemented.XXXXXIXXXll see the principal.XXXXXThere was a little pause. Poke rose from his ledge, and descended theXslope of the council rock.XXXXXIf we donXXXt mean to keep Lon waiting, weXXXd better adjourn theXmeeting,XXX he remarked. XXXBut your notion may be all right, Sam--youXXXveXtraces of brains now and then. Only, your way isnXXXt exactly quickXaction. ItXXXs going to call for time, maybe a long time. And meanwhileXwe wonXXXt be really enjoying life.XXXXXSam rose, too. XXXYes, weXXXre due to start, if weXXXre to catch Lon,XXX heXsaid. XXXBut if any of you fellows can offer a better scheme----XXXXXXXXWe canXXXt!XXX said Orkney crisply.XXXXXThen youXXXre ready to try my way, even if it may seem slow?XXXXXXXXYes,XXX said the club, in chorus. XXXWeXXXll try it.XXXXXXXXCHAPTER V LON GOES SCOUTINGXXXWith Lon Gates it was not a case of XXXout of sight, out of mind,XXX so farXas Sam was concerned.XXFor years Lon had taken a very keen interest in the fortunes andXmisfortunes of Sam and his friends, had served as their confidantXand counselor, and had shared in some of their adventures. NaturalXshrewdness and long acquaintance combined to give him a ratherXremarkable insight into their problems, which he found peculiarlyXentertaining, on occasion. Lon, as he sometimes confessed, XXXliked toXfigger out things.XXX It tickled his sense of humor, and possibly anXinnocent vanity, now and then to do a little detective work, so toXspeak; get to the bottom of some case in which the boys were concerned;Xthen amaze them by putting his knowledge to their practical service.XXIn the present instance Lon was disposed to regard SamXXXs difficulty asXpresumably fairly serious. Putting one thing with another, he inclinedXto the theory that it grew out of incidents at school. Sam plainlyXregarded the trouble--whatever it might be--as real. Lon ran over inXmind the chances for friction in studies, in athletics, in what mayXbe called the social side of school life. So far as he had heard fromXthe boys of the club, none of these offered especially rough places.XHe inferred that whatever had happened, had happened unexpectedly andXrecently; doubtless, within a few hours. Lon whistled softly.XXXXXThey say itXXXs pooty near unanimously voted that it takes two to make aXquarrel,XXX he soliloquized. XXXThereXXXll be Sam and his crowd, and thereXXXllXbe the other fellers. And mebbe the othersXXXll be talkinXXX. I dunno of noXjest cause and impediment why I shouldnXXXt listen and keep my eyes doinXXXXbusiness as usual. And so--letXXXs see--what weXXXll see.XXXXXLon knew the town like a book. He knew the playgrounds and the favoriteXlounging places. Moreover, he had ready excuse for visiting them. ThereXwere half a dozen errands to be done; he took the car and sallied forthXon his round.XXA few small boys were playing on the high school grounds, but he didnXXXtXhalt to observe them; they were younger than the club and not likelyXto be involved in its affairs. At street corners he noticed two orXthree groups of high school pupils, and marked that they were talkingXearnestly. Then he came to the field where the baseball diamond wasXlaid out, and where a scrub game was in progress. There was a fringe ofXspectators about the field, and half a dozen cars and wagons were linedXat the curb. Lon drew up behind a truck, whose driver was killing aXspare quarter of an hour. The man on the truck nodded.XXXXXHXXXlo, Lon! How be?XXXXXXXXFair to middlinXXX,XXX said Lon. XXXGuess if the weather man was diagnosinXXXXmy troubles heXXXd be sayinXXX something about a faintly developed troughXoXXX depression, but not flyinXXX no storm signals. And howXXXs the rest oXXXXthe Grand Lodge oXXX the Sons of Rest?XXXXXXXXHoldinXXX protracted session, I guess,XXX quoth the truckman cheerfully.XXXXBusiness ainXXXt what it used to be,XXX he added with a sudden change ofXnote.XXXXXKinder lucky thing for business, at that,XXX Lon countered. XXXGot to keepXup with the times, you know--same as we do.... Say! WhoXXXs at bat?XXXXXXXXDunno. Guess he ainXXXt one of the regXXXlars.XXXXXXXXDonXXXt hold himself like one,XXX Lon agreed. He ran his eye over theXplayers and spectators. There was something half-hearted about theXgame, and the boys about the diamond were not displaying keen interestXin its progress. None of the club was in sight, but he recognized aXnumber of SamXXXs classmates, among them Ed Zorn.XXLon kept closely enough in touch with the affairs of his young friendsXto be aware that Zorn and the Safety First boys were not on termsXof intimacy. It was a logical thing, therefore, for him to watch EdXkeenly, his theory being that Sam was involved in some difficulty withXhis schoolmates. Zorn, in other words, was as likely as anybody else toXbe concerned in the dispute. So Lon studied the suspect. More, he madeXa discovery or two.XXZorn, for one thing, was paying no attention to the game. He wasXsauntering back and forth along the line behind first base, going fromXone group to the next. Lon noted that almost invariably he became theXcenter of a little cluster of boys, to whom he appeared to talk veryXearnestly for a moment or two. The performance was repeated so oftenXthat Lon made up his mind there was method in it.XXXXXThat feller makes me think of a ward worker before a caucus,XXX heXreflected. XXXActs as if he wanted to get XXXem all goinXXX his way, and wasXhandinXXX out steerinXXX directions.... And thereXXXs that other youngsterXdanglinXXX after him, and wigglinXXX as oneasy as uninvited company thatXXXsXheard the dinner bell ring and ainXXXt been asked to draw up and set in.XXXXXThe lad to whom Lon referred was Hagle, whose movements and bearingXjustified the comparison he had drawn. Hagle was behaving like aXsatellite of Zorn, bearing him company, following him about, nowXdrawing close, now retiring, uneasily alert for word of command. LonXwhistled softly.XXXXXTalk about coach dogs runninXXX under a wagon or after it----XXX he saidXto himself. XXXSomehow thatXXXs kind of a poor job for a human. And thatXfeller ainXXXt gettinXXX the fun out of it that a dog does; he ainXXXtXhappy.... Funny, all XXXround, ainXXXt it?XXXXXThe truckman was yawning audibly. Lon gave him a glance.XXXXXGoinXXX to be able to tear off a few more minutes from your pressinXXXXengagements and stay here?XXX he inquired. XXXCan, eh? Then keep an eye onXmy car, will you? Guess IXXXll try for a close-up on that bush leaguinXXX.XXXXXXXXHuh! NobodyXXXll steal your old machine!XXX grunted the other.XXXXXNobody has--yet,XXX said Lon drily. XXXHate to give XXXem a chance to formXthe habit. All right! Back in a minute or two, or mebbe nine or ten.XXXXXLon glanced at his watch as he strolled away; he could spare a quarterXof an hour for the task in hand. He was grinning, a bit sheepishly.XXXXXItXXXs in the blood and you canXXXt get it out--this taste for tryinXXXXto be a Shylock Holmes,XXX he reflected. XXXBut thereXXXs something queerXa-doinXXX, or IXXXve got to start in and learn boys all over again.... Now,XletXXXs see--what weXXXll see.XXXXXJust then the batter sent up a long, high foul; a fielder and aXbaseman came charging among the spectators; there was a scurrying ofXmen and boys to avoid ball and players, and when the confusion hadXsubsided and the ball, uncaught, had been retrieved, Lon found himselfXneighbor to a cluster of youths with Zorn in the center of the ring.XXThere was a buzz of talk. Voices were not raised--Lon made mental noteXof the circumstance. Hagle was moving uneasily about the group--XXXdoinXXXXthe flea on the griddle dance,XXX Lon called it. Then Zorn broke awayXfrom the others. Hagle was after him instantly. He said something, andXZorn turned upon him menacingly. Hagle cowered, and shrank back. ZornXmoved on, and Hagle trotted at his heels.XXIt was a curious performance; and it interested Lon. He might be wildlyXoff the track in his suspicions, but, somehow, his theory that SamXXXsXtrouble and ZornXXXs activities were related was growing stronger everyXminute. He saw Ed pause for a few words with other groups; reach theXend of the line; turn and retrace his steps, Hagle still following him.XXLon sat down on the ground. He clasped his arms about his knees, andXstared industriously at the batter. His ears, though, were devoted toXwhat might be doing just behind him, where Zorn and Hagle were aboutXto pass his station. They came along, Zorn at his easy pace and JackXshuffling closer. He was speaking eagerly, pleadingly, though Lon couldXnot catch the words.XXAgain Zorn whipped about.XXXXXOh, muzzle that whine, Jack!XXX Lon heard this clearly enough. XXXThisXthingXXXs working just right, I tell you.XXXXXXXXI--I know, but----XXX Lon lost the rest of it, for HagleXXXs voice wasXweak.XXXXXWell, if you know, act as if you _did_ know.XXXXXHagleXXXs voice rose shrilly. XXXI donXXXt like it, Ed; I donXXXt like it, IXsay!XXXXXZornXXXs laugh was like the snap of a whip. XXXGo home, then! You donXXXtXhave to be here.XXXXXXXXBut--but I----XXXXXXXXOh, keep quiet!XXXXXXXXI canXXXt. I donXXXt like it.XXXXXXXXYou donXXXt have to like it.XXXXXXXXIt isnXXXt right; it isnXXXt square; itXXXs----XXXXXLon heard the slap of ZornXXXs hand on HagleXXXs shoulder.XXXXXBrace up, Jack! Be sensible. When luckXXXs running our way, make theXmost of it. And you donXXXt have to do anything--just let it run. JustXbecause that gang happened----XXXXXThere Zorn broke off. Whether he had observed Lon and recognizedXhim, or whether he thought he had said enough, anyway, Lon could notXdetermine. Out of a corner of his eye, he saw Zorn leading Hagle away.XXLon got upon his feet. In very leisurely fashion he sauntered back toXhis car.XXXXXI reckon I know moreXXXn I did a while ago,XXX he told himself. XXXStill,XIXXXd give a pooty penny to know jest what XXXtis I know. Good deal likeXfindinXXX an old daguerreotype in the attic, and not beinXXX sure whetherXitXXXs Uncle Simon that went to the legislater, or tXXXother uncle thatXwent to jail. Guess IXXXll have to do some thinkinXXX, but, at that,XI ainXXXt ready to allow that IXXXve altogether wasted my time thisXafternoon.XXXXXXXXCHAPTER VI POKE TAKES A FLYERXXXIt was nearly a mile from the council rock to the road on which theXclub was to meet Lon Gates on his return from the Ridge; and as theXafternoon was well advanced the boys made a forced march of it. All ofXthem were panting from a dog-trot across the last field, when they cameXto the highway, and saw the Parker car approaching at a leisurely pace.XSo, when Lon pulled up and grinned at them cheerfully, evidencing noXdesire for haste, none of them was in a hurry to climb into the machine.XXXXXWhat did you think of the pond?XXX Lon inquired. XXXAnd howXXXs the modernXimprovements progressinXXX? GettinXXX to be quite meetropolitan, eh?XXXXXSam laughed. XXXWe could see a lot of building going on, but we didnXXXtXnotice a crowd, Lon. Fact is, we stayed on the other side of the lake.XXXXXXXXStumbled on a bully place and tied up there,XXX Step contributed.XXLon wagged his head sagely. XXXReckon you made the best pick, at that.XAs I remember it, the pootiest side of the pond is across from theXsyndicateXXXs land. And there used to be a big rock----XXXXXXXXScooped out toward the water--like part of a saucer, you know?XXX PokeXbroke in.XXXXXThatXXXs the feller.XXXXXXXXWell, itXXXs there yet.XXXXXLonXXXs eyes twinkled. XXXDo tell! And yet I donXXXt know as itXXXs soXsurprisinXXX, rocks havinXXX a way oXXX stayinXXX put. Set a good example forXfolks, donXXXt they? But, as I was sayinXXX, I remember that old rock andXthe fishinXXX we used to have jest opposite it--bass, mostly. And up backXa piece was a spring. I tell you, boys, if I was goinXXX campinXXX at theXpond, thatXXXs jest about where IXXXd tie up.XXXXXXXXIt did seem to be a good place, and IXXXd----XXX Sam began, but paused inXmid-sentence. XXXWhy--whatXXXs that?XXXXXEverybody had heard the sounds which had caught SamXXXs attention. UpXthe road, in the direction from which Lon had come, something wasXhappening, something extraordinarily and violently noisy. There was aXsuccession of reports; then a broken and uneven rattle; then anotherXseries of explosions, louder than before and evidently nearer.XXXXXGreat Scott! It must be a machine-gun!XXX gasped Step.XXXXXIf it is, weXXXll have to duck,XXX said Herman Boyd. XXXThe thingXXXs comingXthis way.XXXXXXXXAnd here it is!XXX cried Poke.XX[Illustration: SOMETHING SHOT INTO VIEW]XXSomething shot into view, a black something which was raising aXtremendous cloud of dust and which was traveling at reckless speed.XLon shouted a warning to the boys to stand aside, threw on his power,Xand steered his car far into the ditch. As he did so, it was as if aXroaring cyclone swept past. The noise of it deafened the club, the dustXit sent swirling in clouds choked them, its velocity dazed them. ThatXthe cause of the commotion was an automobile they realized, but none ofXthem had an idea what manner of car it might be, or, indeed, how manyXpassengers it carried.XXLon steered back into the road.XXXXXAll aboard, everybody!XXX he called. XXXThereXXXs a feller thatXXXs findinXXXXthe goinXXX too good to last. LetXXXs follow and see if we can pick upXenough oXXX the pieces to tell what kind of a machine XXXtwas.XXXXXNo second invitation was needed. The boys swarmed into the touring car.XXXXXHurry!XXX Sam urged. XXXThat fellowXXXs in trouble now. You canXXXt hear hisXengine any more.XXXXXIt was quite true. The loud reports had ceased abruptly; there were noXsounds from beyond the bend in the road where the speeding driver hadXvanished.XXLon gave his young friends an excellent exhibition of how fast aXcareful chauffeur can go, on occasion. But he had not far to go--lessXthan a quarter-mile, in fact. Then he was throwing on his brakes, andXwhistling shrilly as he did so.XXThe other car--or what was left of it--was across the ditch. It lay onXits side, with its front axle jammed against a boulder. The cover ofXthe hood had been torn off, and the engine was exposed. The leather topXwas in ribbons; the cushions had vanished. One back wheel lay againstXthe stone wall bordering the road.XXXXXJee-ru-salem!XXX Lon exclaimed. XXXIXXXll bet a lot oXXX things happened toXthe citizen managinXXX that joy ride, and happened all of a sudden! ButXwhere is he?XXXXXAs if in answer a figure raised itself beyond the wall. Lon drew a longXbreath of relief.XXXXXSay, but I thought he must XXXaXXX been killed, sure for sartain! ItXXXs anXamazinXXX mercy heXXXs got a leg left to stand on!XXXXXWith that, Lon was out of the car, and striding to the strangerXXXs aid,Xthe boys pressing closely behind him. But, as the event proved, thereXwas very little for them to do.XXThe man--he was a tall, gaunt person with a wisp of chin beard--seemedXto have come to no great bodily harm, though his clothing was rippedXand torn, his hat was missing, and the sole of one of his shoes flappedXlike a loose slipper when he moved. From the clump of brush, into whichXhe had been projected, and which mercifully had broken the force ofXhis fall, he limped forward, a step at a time, pausing to bend a knee,Xtest an elbow, or otherwise investigate the extent of his injuries. LonXtried to offer him a supporting arm, but was waved back.XXXXXNo; let me stand on my own feet, Mister--kinder a luxury I find it toXbe able to,XXX said the man. XXXSay, but we must XXXaXXX been goinXXX some!XXXXXXXXAll oXXX that--and then a little more,XXX Lon assured him.XXThe man rubbed his eyes. XXXI dunnoXXXs I happen to know you folks, but IXcalXXXlate youXXXre the crowd I passed a rod or so back.XXXXXXXXCall it a couple oXXX forty-rods.XXXXXXXXWell, mebbe. There was sort of a blur side of the road, but IXXXd gotXother things to think about. And say! was we touchinXXX ground anywhereXwhen we went by you?XXXXXXXXNot as I noticed,XXX Lon told him.XXThe man nodded. XXXShe was a goer, all right, that machine! But sheXwaXXXnXXXt no ladyXXXs drivinXXX car. Feller that let me have her said that,Xand, by gum, he hit it!XXXXXXXXLooks that way,XXX Lon agreed. XXXBut donXXXt you belong over WatervilleXway? And ainXXXt your name Haskins? XXXTis, eh? Thought IXXXd seen youXbefore.XXXXXXXXOh, IXXXm Jabe Haskins, sure enough,XXX said the other. XXXDonXXXt wonder youXdidnXXXt recognize me fust-off. Guess I must have aged twenty yearsXwhile I was shootinXXX over that stun wall. You see, I was wonderinXXXXwhich of the fifty-seven possible ways IXXXd hit when I landed; butXpshaw! I was clean off the track, for I hit all of XXXem. Guess thatXXXsXwhat saved my neck--kinder distributed the shock, yXXXknow. But IXXXllXnever again be the man I was! Whew! but IXXXm all one ache, and dentedXfrom one end of me to the other!XXXXXXXXCourse, if you want to over-speed----XXX Lon began, but Haskins cut himXshort.XXXXXXXXTwaXXXnXXXt what I wanted to do, Mister, but what that blessed machineXdid. Bolted, she did! Took the bit in her teeth, and went it for keeps!XFust time IXXXd been runninXXX her, yXXXsee. Jest swapped for her. Turned inXa hoss and somethinXXX to boot and----XXXXXIt was LonXXXs chance to interrupt. XXXIXXXm placinXXX you now for sure. Done aXlot oXXX hoss tradinXXX, hainXXXt you, in your time?XXXXXXXXYep--thatXXXs my regXXXlar line. But I got ambitious and wanted to try myXluck with one of them chug-chugs. So we settled a trade, we did, andXtXXXother party showed me how to set her goinXXX, and I climbed aboard andXstarted out to give her a warminXXX-up jog, as you might say. But lookXhere, Mister! we hit a race gait right off, and the more I tried toXpull her in, the more we touched only the high places. So all I couldXdo was to hope to hold the track and wait for her to run down--whichXalso she didnXXXt. Say, what do you sXXXpose was the matter? Feller I gotXher from--heXXXs a left-hander, he is. That make any difference, wouldXit, in her rigginXXX? All I know is, when I pressed a jimcrack, sheXjumped; and when I quit that and started in on something else, sheXjumped harder. WaXXXnXXXt half-broke, she waXXXnXXXt!XXXXXLon stepped back and inspected the wreck in the ditch.XXXXXDunnoXXXs I can quite place this machine,XXX he said presently. XXXStrangeXmake to me. Never saw one like it before.XXXXXXXXGood reason--there ainXXXt no other like her. Only one made and thenXthey bust the mold. Leastwise, thatXXXs what the party said.XXXXXXXXUmph!XXX said Lon. He was still looking closely at the car, whichXwas--or had been--a runabout or roadster, with a single seat, very highXbacked, and a peculiarly lumpy, box-like construction at the rear.XXMr. Haskins took a few limping steps, groaning slightly. It was plainXenough that, while he had escaped broken bones, he must be sorelyXbruised. He glared for a moment at the ruins.XXXXXParty allowed he built her himself,XXX he explained. XXXLet on he--heXassembled her himself--yes, thatXXXs what he called it, assembled. GotXtired of takinXXX other folksXXX dust on the road, so he figgered on givinXXXXher plenty of power--and, by gum, he done it! He was makinXXX his bragsXabout the engine--said XXXtwaXXXnXXXt the ordinary automobile style, but aXspecial high-speed affair, thatXXXd been meant for one of them flyinXXXXmachines--hey, whatXXXs the matter, sonny?XXXXXThe question was due to a sudden movement by Poke, who in new eagernessXto examine the motor, almost upset Mr. Haskins.XXPoke made no reply. Mr. Haskins, having recovered his balance, resumedXhis observations:XXXXXWal, I reckon I was givinXXX a pooty fair imitation of flyinXXX, myself.XBut XXXtwaXXXnXXXt no business for a man of my age and habits to be in--IXsee that before weXXXd gone a hundred yards. And now see whatXXXs happenedXto the pair of us--me and the machine both! And to think that I gaveXsomething to boot in makinXXX the trade!XXXXXXXXThrew in a horse, too, didnXXXt you?XXX queried Lon.XXMr. Haskins grinned wryly. XXXI sure did! That ainXXXt what hurts, though.XThe hoss--wal, I didnXXXt give no guarantee with him; but the money--say,Xthat was real money, and I might as well XXXaXXX thrown it to the birds!XAnd what have I got to show for it? Jest a junk heap in a ditch thatXainXXXt wuth haulinXXX home.XXXXXPoke, who had been peering at the motor, straightened his back, seemedXto be about to speak, changed his intention, and moved slowly away fromXthe car. As he passed Step, he touched his arm. Sam in a moment moreXsaw the two, with their heads together, conferring earnestly.XXLon made a leisurely circuit of the wreck, inspecting it from allXpoints of view. Mr. Haskins sat down on the ground, and resumedXinvestigation of his contusions.XXXXXWhen they get through stickinXXX court plaster on me, IXXXll be wuss offXthan a tattooed man in a show,XXX he announced gloomily. XXXTalk aboutXbarbed wire! XXXTainXXXt got nothinXXX on a good, healthy thorn bush, whenXyou dive in, head fust!XXXXXXXXWeXXXll take you to a doctor,XXX Lon offered. XXXWhenever youXXXre ready weXXXllXstart.XXXXXMr. Haskins, with a groan or two, gained his feet.XXPoke left Step, and hurried to Sam.XXXXXSay, got any money?XXX he whispered. XXXQuick! Let me have all youXXXve got!XXXXXSam mechanically dug a hand into his pocket. XXXI--IXXXve only some change,XPoke. How much do you need? And what do you need it for?XXXXXPoke groaned as soulfully as Mr. Haskins had groaned. XXXOh, but youXalways have money, Sam!XXX he urged. XXXLook and make sure!XXXXXSamXXXs hand came out of his pocket. It held a half-dollar, a dime, and aXfew pennies.XXXXXThereXXXs my cash,XXX he said. XXXCount it for yourself.XXXXXPoke was a picture of despondency. XXXXXXTisnXXXt enough--it canXXXt be enough.XIXXXve got to have some dollars, anyway.XXXXXXXXWhat for?XXX Sam asked curiously.XXPoke clutched his arm. XXXYou know the fix IXXXm in--about debts, I mean? IXowe all you fellows.XXXXXXXXNonsense!XXX said Sam sharply. XXXWeXXXve told you over and over again toXforget it.XXXXXThere were times when the plump Poke could assume an air of melancholyXdignity. He had it now, as he said:XXXXXI canXXXt forget it. You wouldnXXXt, and couldnXXXt, if you were in myXshoes.XXXXXXXXWell?XXX said Sam inquiringly. PokeXXXs debts, as earlier accounts of theXaffairs of the Safety First Club have related, followed an unhappyXepisode, in which a costly vase was destroyed. With the help of hisXchums, Poke had paid the bill, but the contributions had taxed theirXresources.XXXXXWell, I mean to pay you fellows back, and I think I see a way to doXit. IXXXve told Step, and heXXXs strong for the scheme.XXXXXXXXOh, is he?XXX SamXXXs tone was not enthusiastic; Step was more likely toXbe a sympathizer than a coolly calculating counselor.XXXXXYou bet he is! And StepXXXs all right.XXXXXXXXOf course he is--he means well. But whatXXXs the idea?XXXXXXXXThe bulliest ever! ItXXXs the chance of a lifetime! But I say, Sam!XXXXMr. Haskins was limping toward the Parker car. XXXSam, I canXXXt let himXgo till I find out if the thing can be worked. But, if you havenXXXt anyXmoney, who in the crowd has?XXXXXXXXLon might have some. He generally----XXXXXPoke waited to hear no more. He sprang to Lon, caught his sleeve, beganXto plead with all his eloquence:XXXXXDo me the biggest favor a fellow ever asked you to do! Lend me someXmoney. IXXXll pay you back, sure, and IXXXll be your friend all my days.XOh, but IXXXm in dead earnest, XXXdeed I am!XXXXXXXXDoes look that way,XXX Lon admitted. XXXBut what do you want money for,Xout here? How you goinXXX to manage to spend it?XXXXXPoke dropped his voice, but Mr. Haskins and Sam heard as well as Lon.XXXXXI want to buy that motor.XXXXXXXXWhat! That mess?XXXXXXXXYes; IXXXve got a scheme. I want it.XXXXXXXXHeh?XXX Mr. Haskins had turned, and was hobbling back. XXXHeh? thinkinXXXXof buyinXXX that engine, be you? WhatXXXll you give?XXXXXXXXHow much will you sell it for?XXXXXXXXHundred dollars,XXX said Mr. Haskins promptly. XXXHundred--and dirt cheapXat that. That ainXXXt no common, ordinary machine, young man.XXXXXPoor PokeXXXs face lengthened. XXXOh, a hundred?XXX he repeated faintly.XXXXXAltogether too much!XXX Lon said with decision.XXMr. Haskins shot him a wrathful glance but spoke smoothly:XXXXXOh, call that a fust askinXXX price. And, seeinXXX as how weXXXre allXfriends together, and how the machineXXXs a little jolted, as you mightXsay, suppose you say what you thinkXXXs a fair offer.XXXXXLon turned to Poke, and saw the eagerness in his eyes. He took out anXold-fashioned wallet, opened it, extracted a couple of bills.XXXXXPoke,XXX he said, XXXI guess youXXXve sot your heart on this foolishness. IfXyou have--wal, I ainXXXt no connooshur on relics, and I dunno the goinXXXXprice oXXX curios, but I donXXXt mind lendinXXX you a dollar or two.XXXXXXXXIf youXXXre lookinXXX for speed, young man,XXX Mr. Haskins urged, XXXyou wonXXXtXhave to look no further. You seen me and you seen how I was goinXXX it,Xwhen I waXXXnXXXt half tryinXXX. And fifty dollars ainXXXt so wuss when----XXXXXXXXOh, fiftyXXXs too much,XXX Poke said hastily.XXXXXItXXXs dirt cheap,XXX Mr. Haskins insisted.XXLon glanced inquiringly at Sam, grunted, and somewhat ostentatiouslyXprepared to return the bills to the pocketbook. Poke blanched, but ofXall concerned Mr. Haskins appeared to be most deeply affected. ThereXwas something like a sob in his voice as he said:XXXXXOh, come now! XXXTainXXXt good luck to start a trade and stop this way.XAnd a good, enterprisinXXX youngster can have a lot of fun playinXXX with aXcrackerjack engine like this, and so----XXXXXXXXI donXXXt want it to play with,XXX Poke objected with dignity. XXXAnd all IXcare for is the motor; the rest of the machine would be of no use toXme.XXXXXMr. Haskins was watching Lon and the disappearing bills.XXXXXSay, make me a bid, if you donXXXt like the askinXXX price,XXX said he. XXXIXainXXXt hoggish, and I allers did fancy doinXXX favors for folks thatXtreat me right.XXXXXXXXAnd that hoss you swapped for the car waXXXnXXXt so much of a hoss, afterXall, come to think of it,XXX suggested Lon shrewdly.XXMr. Haskins grinned. XXXI swan! but maybe thereXXXs something to that, too.XStill, he could stand up and keep goinXXX.XXXXXXXXThatXXXs moreXXXn you can say for the machine,XXX Lon remarked pointedly.XXMr. Haskins bent over the wreckage for another brief inspection.XXXXXHuh! She does seem to be kinder generally foundered-like,XXX heXadmitted. XXXAnd you say you donXXXt care for the hide and hoofs, eh? TheXbody and wheels, I mean? Wal, whatXXXll you give?XXXXXPoke caught LonXXXs eye. For the life of him he couldnXXXt explain how heXseemed to read a message there.XXXXXTe-ten dollars,XXX he faltered.XXMr. Haskins groaned more dismally than he had groaned because of hisXbodily hurts.XXXXXTen dollars,XXX Poke repeated--firmly this time; for now he readXdistinct encouragement in LonXXXs glance.XXMr. Haskins shook his head, but with no marked vigor.XXXXXItXXXd be robbinXXX the poor, that price!XXX he objected.XXLon again produced the bills. XXXOne five and another five,XXX he counted.XXXXThatXXXs right, ainXXXt it?XXXXXXXXItXXXs wussXXXn highway robbery, but I--I dunno----XXX said Mr. Haskins, andXdrew nearer.XXLon extended the money. XXXGoinXXX--goinXXX----XXX he began.XXXXXGone!XXX cried Mr. Haskins, and snatched the bills. XXXDone--itXXXs a trade!XXXXXXXXAnd with plenty oXXX witnesses,XXX Lon added emphatically. Then he turnedXto the trembling and excited Poke.XXXXXThe engineXXXs yours, though I ainXXXt got a ghost of a notion what youXwant the junk for.XXXXXMr. Haskins tittered. XXXTe he, te he! Mebbe heXXXs jest takinXXX a flyer.XXXXXThen Poke smiled, and the smile was curiously full of meaning.XXXXXYouXXXve said it for me,XXX quoth he, very cheerily.XXXXXCHAPTER VII IN WHICH SAM PLAYS NEGOTIATORXXXSam, having given his word to the club, duly presented himself at theXprincipalXXXs office.XXThough he had rehearsed carefully the little speech he intended toXmake, he found himself stammering, and hesitating, and, finally,Xblurting out a rather incoherent summary of his case.XXXXXIt was the way things worked, sir--made me seem to say what I didnXXXtXmean to say. And it was the same with the Trojan--with Walker, that is.XBoth of us were tangled, and twisted--and--and----XXXXXXXXYes?XXX the principal encouraged.XXXXXWell, and tricked,XXX said Sam.XXThe head of the school glanced at him sharply. XXXThatXXXs an ugly word,XParker,XXX he said curtly.XXSam reddened, but held his ground. XXXI donXXXt mean that it was intendedXso, but it worked like a trick, sir. If the book had been shown to theXTrojan right at the start, and heXXXd been asked if it was his, heXXXd haveXsaid it was and made no bones about it, even if he hadnXXXt a notion howXyou came to have it. But he was asked first where his Cicero was. Now,Xhe hadnXXXt missed it, and supposed it was with the rest of his books,Xand----XXXXXXXXYouXXXre making a statement, Parker, that it might be difficult toXprove.XXXXXXXXI know that, sir. But I know, too, how it could happen that the TrojanXdidnXXXt miss his Cicero. There had been no Latin recitation for ourXclass since the test; he had had no occasion to look for the book.XXXXXXXXYet we had your word for it, Parker, that he had it with him at theXtime of the examination.XXXXXXXXNo, sir--just before the time. ThatXXXs a big difference.XXXXXXXXAdmitted!XXX said the principal drily.XXXXXJust outside the room I borrowed the Cicero for a moment. Then I gaveXit back--the Trojan wanted it. Then the bell rang and we left our booksXin the corridor.XXXXXXXXDid Walker?XXXXXXXXYes, sir.XXXXXXXXHow can you be sure he did? Did you see him leave his text there?XXXXXXXXI didnXXXt see him--at least, I didnXXXt notice. But he says he did, and IXbelieve him.XXXXXThe principal was eyeing Sam keenly. There was a brief pause. Then saidXhe:XXXXXYouXXXve something to add? Go on!XXXXXSam summoned all his resolution. XXXI was talking about being tricked. IXwas caught, too, by the way the questions were put. Somehow, I seemedXto be made to give the Trojan away. I hadnXXXt any notion of doing that,Xand there wasnXXXt any reason why I should, seeing that he hadnXXXt doneXanything wrong. But Mr. Bacon seemed to tangle both of us up. Do youXremember, sir, how he didnXXXt go straight at the thing, but fussedXaround it, and--and----XXXXXXXXI do remember,XXX said the principal, when Sam hesitated. There wasXsomething in his tone which reminded the boy of his curious doubt thatXthe head of the school had really approved the course the inquisitionXtook.XXXXXWell, sir, in the end I appeared to have done the Trojan a lot ofXharm, and heXXXd harmed himself, and it was all a mix-up. ThatXXXs what IXmeant by the trick part.XXXXXXXXI see,XXX said the principal. Again there was a pause.XXXXXThe Trojan is honest,XXX was the way Sam resumed the discussion.XXXXXParker, let me show you the other side of the case,XXX said theXprincipal quietly. XXXFor some time we have had reason to believe thatXthere has been cheating in examinations, and have been keeping a closeXwatch on all the classes. There is, as you know, a strict rule againstXtaking text-books into rooms where examinations are held. In thisXcase, after your class had taken Latin papers, a Cicero was found inXone of the desks. We established, beyond doubt, that it was the deskXWalker had used. There was evidence that the book was his. When he wasXquestioned, opportunity was given him to make confession----XXXXXXXXBut that was prejudging him guilty, sir!XXXXXThe principal coughed. XXXI get your point, Parker, but must remind youXthat we are interested rather in maintaining discipline and doingXessential justice, than in following rules of court procedure.XWalkerXXXs course was unfortunate. It certainly did not serve to lessenXthe strong presumption of his guilt.XXXXXXXXBut what was I brought in for?XXXXXXXXTo assist in establishing all available facts. And you furnished someXinformation, which surely bore directly upon the question at issue.XXXXXXXXI know--it seemed to,XXX Sam admitted dismally. XXXThatXXXs the hardestXpart, so far as IXXXm concerned.XXXXXXXXI understand your position,XXX the principal told him, not unkindly.XXSam took thought for a moment. XXXWell, sir, thereXXXs another side to theXcase--whatXXXs the Trojan to do, that is. And--and--was he given a markXon that Latin paper?XXXXXXXXA mark of zero.XXXXXXXXAfterward--yes. But was there a mark to begin with?XXXXXXXXYes,XXX said the principal. He opened his desk, took out three or fourXsheets of paper, closely written in a hand Sam recognized as theXTrojanXXXs. XXXAll the papers were marked at once, as it happened. WalkerXwas given an eighty-two. That was canceled, of course, after theXinvestigation, and is out of the reckoning.XXXXXXXXI donXXXt think it should be, sir,XXX Sam argued. XXXItXXXs important. If theXTrojan had been doing any crooked work, heXXXd have turned in a betterXpaper. He usually has had eighty-five or more in examinations.XXXXXThe principal consulted a record-book.XXXXXQuite true,XXX he admitted. XXXLetXXXs see! HereXXXs an eighty-seven--thatXwas a test; he fell just under eighty-five in the next one, butXpicked up again at mid-yearXXXs. Then I find an eighty-six and next anXeighty-seven.XXXXXXXXAll higher than eighty-two,XXX Sam pointed out.XXXXXGranted. I canXXXt grant, though, direct application to the mainXquestion before us.XXXXXXXXWhich is that you think the Trojan lied?XXX Sam asked bluntly.XXXXXThat is certainly the most serious aspect of the case.XXXXXSam reflected swiftly. XXXWell, sir,XXX he said, XXXIXXXm sure he didnXXXt lie,Xand I believe some day we can prove he didnXXXt. But, meanwhile, weXXXveXgot to figure on what he can do. That zero will smash his term-stand.XAs he isnXXXt to be allowed to recite with the class in Latin, heXXXllXhave no chance to pull it up; so, even if he came in for the final andXdid mighty well, heXXXd probably be flunked.XXXXXXXXIt might be.XXXXXXXXWell, I--we--his friends, I mean--donXXXt want to have him flunked. WeXXXdXdo anything to prevent it. And that brings me to something weXXXd like toXhave arranged and understood. If the Trojan keeps up in his Latin byXoutside work, and this--this other thing is cleared up, and he passesXthe final, what can be done about his term marks?XXXXXIt was plain that the principal, if not persuaded of the TrojanXXXsXinnocence, was impressed by SamXXXs earnestness.XXXXXIf your hopes can be realized, Parker, and if we can be shown thatXWalker is a victim of circumstances--I warn you, itXXXs a difficult taskXyou appear to have set yourself--if you can clear his record, you canXdepend upon me to give him fair play.XXXXXXXXThen youXXXll fix the term-stand part of it?XXX Sam insisted.XXXXXYes--on condition the other requirement is met.XXXXXXXXThat we prove he didnXXXt take the Cicero into the room, and supposedXthe book was with the rest of his lot?XXXXXThe principal smiled. XXXProof of the second proposition, Parker, mightXbe beyond even the efforts of the strongest friendship. I fear evidenceXof his mental processes cannot be secured. But if you can establishXthe fact that he did not have his text with him that day, while he wasXworking on his paper, it will be quite enough. Convince me of so much,Xand youXXXll have no cause to complain--nor will he.XXXXXXXXHurrah!XXX cried Sam, delightedly.XXThere might have been doubt in the principalXXXs expression, but thereXwas surely a trace of sympathy.XXXXXParker, I wish you success in your efforts, though I am notXoversanguine. But you can be assured of this: if we are in error inXpunishing Walker, weXXXll make every effort to make amends.XXXXXXXXI understand, sir. And all we want is a square deal.XXXXXXXXPrecisely,XXX said the principal, and there was the suspicion of aXtwinkle in his eye. XXXPrecisely. The trouble, though, is that on theXface of the returns, that is just what Walker is getting now.XXXXXXXXThen weXXXll change the returns!XXX Sam declared valiantly.XXXXXXXXPon my word, Parker, I shall be very glad to see you do it--if youXcan!XXX said the head of the school.XXXXXCHAPTER VIII DRAWING THE LINEXXXAfterward the club was agreed that many things might have happenedXdifferently, had it not been for the affair of the class secretary.XBut the affair took place, and in its effects had an importance beyondXanybodyXXXs expectations.XXAs a matter of fact, class officers had little to do except in SeniorXyear, when the ceremonies and festivities of graduation increased theirXduties. Several weeks before the troubles of the Trojan and his friendsXbegan the JuniorsXXX secretary had left school, but it had been supposedXthat the class would not elect a successor for the balance of the term.XThere was, therefore, more or less surprise when a notice was posted,Xcalling a class meeting to fill the vacancy.XXSam Parker was especially disturbed. There had been some mention ofXthe Trojan as a candidate for secretary at the regular election atXthe beginning of Senior year, and though Sam himself, as well as someXof the other members of the club, expected to transfer to St. MarkXXXs,Xa famous fitting school, for the last year of their preparation forXcollege, Walker had intended to finish the course at the high school.XIn the call for a special election Sam saw a hostile move: the Trojan,Xin official disgrace, could hardly hope to be chosen, while theXsuccessful candidate would, doubtless, seek reXXlection in Senior yearXwith the prestige of one victory.XXSam had been having his full share of difficulty, anyway, in dealingXwith the Trojan. Walker had taken greatly to heart what he consideredXthe essential injustice of his treatment, and though he kept hisXpledge not to leave the school, there was little energy in his work.XFrom Latin recitations he was barred, as we know. In the case of theXothers he did little more than file appearance. Sam, doing his best toXencourage his chum, was alarmed by the probable results of the classXmeeting and the almost certain slight upon the Trojan.XXThe club held council, and bade Sam have charge of the campaign.XAccordingly, he took special care to be early at the meeting, and, asXsoon as it was opened, to offer a resolution to delay action on theXchoice of a temporary secretary. Step lost no time in seconding theXmotion.XXBut if the club had laid its plans, so, too, had the opposition. Two orXthree boys spoke against postponement. They were influential fellows asXit chanced, and their words carried weight. Then one of the girls tookXthe floor, and made a strong plea for immediate action. Sam, keenlyXwatching his classmates, gained two distinct impressions. One was thatXsentiment was overwhelmingly against him; the other, that though ZornXtook no part in the debate, he was the guiding spirit of the otherXside; for once or twice questioning glances were turned upon him andXwere met by a nod or a shake of the head, as the case might be.XXWhen SamXXXs motion was put to a vote, it met defeat. The chorus ofXXXXNoesXXX gave unmistakable evidence of the prevailing sentiment. Then theXclass president called for nominations for secretary.XXSomebody in the rear of the room sang out XXXScrub Payne!XXX Two or threeXothers seconded the nomination almost simultaneously.XXXXXAnybody else?XXX inquired the president.XXJack Hagle rose to his feet. XXXI--I want to nominate Trojan Walker,XXX heXsaid, unsteadily.XXSam whirled in his seat to stare at Hagle, who took special pains toXavoid his eye.XXXXXNomination seconded?XXX asked the president briskly.XXSam sent a warning glance at his club-mates. His wits were working, andXrealizing that the Trojan could not be elected, he meant to do his bestXto spare him the humiliation of a defeat.XXXXXSeconded!XXXXXAgain it was a contribution from the back of the room; Sam was not sureXwhich of a group of half a dozen boys spoke.XXXXXAny further nominations?XXX queried the president. XXXIf not, we willXproceed to vote.XXXXXSam sprang up. XXXI wish to withdraw WalkerXXXs name,XXX he said. XXXHe is notXa candidate.XXXXXA murmur of surprise greeted the statement. Plainly enough, this was anXunexpected development.XXThe presidentXXXs face betrayed perplexity. Sam made a shrewd guessXat the situation: Joe Carson had won the presidency by courtingXpopularity, and this seemed to be turning into an affair in which thatXpopularity might suffer.XXXXXYes, I withdraw WalkerXXXs name,XXX Sam repeated.XXXXXWhy--why--I hardly know----XXX the president began.XXXXXWait a minute, Carson--Mr. President, I mean,XXX interposed Zorn. XXXLetXWalker speak for himself.XXXXXXXXHe isnXXXt here--as you mighty well know!XXX cried Sam hotly.XXThe chairman rapped sharply with his gavel. XXXOrder, please! LetXXXs doXthis according to the rules. Zorn has the floor.XXXXXXXXI wonXXXt need it long,XXX said Zorn coolly. XXXMy point is a simple one.XWhen a fellow has been nominated and seconded, he has to be votedXon unless he himself withdraws. And if Walker doesnXXXt want to beXconsidered, he ought to have been willing to take the trouble to comeXhere and say so. Everybody knows his crowd has been booming him forXthis job. If heXXXs changed his mind, why isnXXXt he here to let us knowXabout it?XXXXXNow, as it chanced, Sam had not urged the TrojanXXXs attendance, and,Xindeed, had deemed it wiser that he stay away from the meeting. ThisXwas hardly a matter for public discussion, however. Step saved theXsituation by creating a diversion. Up he shot like a jack in the box.XXXXXThis is a shame!XXX he shouted. XXXItXXXs a set-up job! I wonXXXt stand forXit! Everybody knows ZornXXXs a trouble maker, but I didnXXXt know till nowXhe could bamboozle nearly the whole class into helping in his dirtyXwork!XXXXXThe chairmanXXXs gavel was beating a tattoo on his desk. Sam caughtXStepXXXs coat and dragged him down into his seat. Zorn scowled, but keptXhis head.XXXXXI say that in WalkerXXXs absence nobody is entitled to speak for himXwithout his authority--ought to be in writing, at that.XXXXXThe president caught at the suggestion. XXXYou make that a point ofXorder?XXXXXXXXYes,XXX said Zorn.XXCarson turned to Sam. XXXHave you any authority?XXXXXXXXSure he has!XXX Step broke in; but the declaration went unheeded.XXXXXIXXXve no authority, in writing,XXX Sam said quietly. XXXBut I donXXXt needXit. I donXXXt admit ZornXXXs point is well taken.XXXXXXXXI rule it is,XXX said the president.XXXXXThen IXXXll appeal to the class.XXXXXBut the class was not with Sam. The vote against him and in support ofXthe chair was five or six to one.XXStep groaned loudly. Then informally but perfectly audibly he expressedXhis opinion of plots and plotters. Angry murmurs rose from the otherXside. The chairman pounded the desk lustily.XXOrkney with difficulty gained recognition.XXXXXI move we adjourn,XXX he said.XXXXXSecond the motion!XXX cried Poke.XXXXXMr. President, thatXXXs out of order,XXX Zorn objected.XXXXXMotion to adjournXXXs always in order,XXX Sam insisted.XXXXXNot with the vote on a secretary pending--you canXXXt side-track it thatXway.XXXXXBy this time half a dozen members of the class were on their feet.XParliamentary practice was supposed to be one of the benefits of theseXmeetings, and this day the Juniors were trying to put to use all theyXknew about methods of procedure.XXCarson was not enjoying his authority as presiding officer, but in hisXdesire to stand with the majority made up his mind to rule OrkneyXXXsXresolution out of order.XXTumult greeted his announcement. Zorn and his followers applauded;XStep, Poke, Herman Boyd and Orkney made loud protest. The Shark,Xunmoved, calmly watched the proceedings through his big spectacles. SamXwas busy with plans for the next move. He understood perfectly thatXthe voting strength was against him; that a carefully arranged plan toXhumiliate the Trojan, and through him the Safety First Club, was beingXcarried out; that he could not avert the election of a secretary, andXthat all that was left for him was to soften the blow so far as heXmight.XXXXXVote! Vote now!XXX Somebody raised the cry, and many voices repeated it.XXThe Shark rose in leisurely fashion. Somehow, though he did not seem toXraise his voice, he managed to make himself heard.XXXXXWritten ballots, then--do it the right way!XXXXXXXXNo, no!XXX XXXWhatXXXs the use?XXX XXXMake it a standing vote!XXX There was aXmedley of objections.XXSam gratefully caught at the SharkXXXs hint. He had no hope, now, ofXavoiding defeat, but it flashed upon him that a secret vote would giveXopportunity to learn the real division of sentiment in the class.XThere might be a number of boys and girls who would yield to popularXclamor, if called upon to declare themselves openly, but who would voteXaccording to their true preferences under the protection of a secretXballot.XXXXXExcept by unanimous consent otherwise, elections have to be byXballot,XXX he declared, vigorously.XXCarson hesitated. Before he could speak, the Shark cut in:XXXXXOf course! Rule--rule everywhere!XXXXXXXXShow us the rule!XXX somebody called out.XXXXXNo need--if you know anything, you know IXXXm right,XXX said the SharkXcontemptuously, and sat down.XXZorn shrugged his shoulders, as if the point at issue had littleXinterest; and the president, upon whom the demonstration was not lost,Xreached decision.XXXXXWeXXXll take a ballot. IXXXll appoint Bert Brown and Herman Boyd tellers.XThey can prepare the slips, and then collect and count them.XXXXXAs the two boys named went forward to the desk, Step whispered to Sam:XXXXWhat shall we do? Cast blanks? WeXXXre licked, anyway.XXXXXSam shook his head. XXXNo; weXXXll see how many friends we have left. If itXhad been a standing vote, we might have let it go by default, but now IXwant to find out what the line-up is.XXXXXWith Sam, Orkney, Step, Poke, Herman and the Shark, the club couldXcount upon six votes for the Trojan. The tally gave him fiveXmore--eleven in all. Scrub Payne had forty-one.XXThe meeting was over, and the club had fared badly. Sam and hisXfriends were close together when they left the room; and it is to beXrelated that nobody tried to force his company upon them. Just thenXthe line was very sharply drawn between the two factions into whichXthe class had divided. In fact, as if to emphasize the division, whileXthe club kept on the right side of the street, the great body of theXother party chose the left in leaving the school grounds. Step, in aXfine rage, was vowing vengeance on Zorn and the rest, Herman and PokeXoccasionally adding suggestions of ways and means. Orkney and the SharkXtrudged along in silence, which in the case of the former had a touchXof doggedness. The Shark appeared to be merely indifferent. Sam beganXto lag a little. There were perhaps a dozen stragglers, who could notXbe said to have attached themselves to either of the rival groups, andXamong these, no doubt, were the five outsiders who had voted with theXclub. Sam tried to puzzle out which had been his allies. The meetingXhad made it evident that the feud which had developed in the class wasXserious enough to indicate a long struggle; and he was anxious to knowXwhom he could depend upon.XXAs a matter of fact, his observations brought him little light. SomeXfellows whom he had deemed his very good friends were openly with Zorn;Xtwo or three others--among them Jack Hagle--with whom he had not beenXon especially good terms, were among the stragglers. So busy was heXwith his problem that he failed to notice that he had fallen quite aXdistance behind his club-mates, and had been passed by one or two ofXthe strays. He did observe, however, that Hagle was beginning to sidleXtoward him.XXWondering what might be in the wind, Sam slackened his pace. HagleXdrew nearer. What Sam sometimes had called his XXXhang-dogXXX manner wasXpeculiarly in evidence. For a moment or two the pair walked side byXside. Then Hagle spoke, nervously, propitiatingly:XXXXXSay, Parker! I--I voted for Walker.XXXXXSam turned and stared at him. XXXYou? You----XXXXXXXXYes, I did!XXXXXXXXWell, why in thunder shouldnXXXt you?XXX Sam demanded with sudden heat.XXXXYouXXXd got him into the mess by nominating him, hadnXXXt you?XXXXXXXXI--I thought he ought to have it.XXXXXSam laughed harshly. XXXTell that to somebody else! Much you thoughtXabout what he ought to have! All you and your crowd wanted was to putXhim up so that you could knock him down!XXXXXXXXBut I voted for him, I tell you!XXX Hagle protested.XXXXXThen Zorn ordered you to do that, too.XXXXXHagle reddened, but would not meet SamXXXs gaze.XXXXXXXXTisnXXXt so! He didnXXXt want me to----XXX There he checked himself.XXXXHe--he--I mean, I acted on my own hook. Zorn didnXXXt make me do it. TheXclass has been talking Walker for secretary for weeks, and--and--say,XParker, I figured that because heXXXs down on his luck, he--heXXXd feelXbetter if something came his way. I was square about it.XXXXXXXXBosh! You knew the game had been fixed to beat him!XXXXXHagle wriggled. XXXI knew Scrub Payne was going to run, but I thoughtXWalker ought to have his show. Look here! I--IXXXm awfully sorry aboutXthe whole business--about all WalkerXXXs troubles. It--itXXXs mighty hardXluck for him.XXXXXXXXIt surely is!XXX said Sam drily.XXHagle began to edge away. XXXI voted for him, and I wanted to tell youXso. That--thatXXXs all.XXXXXXXXYouXXXve told!XXX Sam growled.XXThe other widened the distance between them. XXXWell, that--thatXXXs allXIXXXve got to say,XXX he mumbled.XXSam made no answer. Hagle seemed to expect none, for he continued toXdraw away from the leader of the Safety First Club, and did not lookXback.XXXXXCHAPTER IX THE CLUB FORMS HOLLOW SQUAREXXXIt meant war. The result of the class meeting was so accepted byXboth the club and its opponents; and though Sam speculated long andXearnestly on the reasons for the sudden enmity, he did not attemptXto deceive himself about the ugly fact. It was plain that somebodyXwas shrewdly taking advantage of the situation to work harm for theXSafety Firsts, and he had no doubt of the identity of the schemer. WhyXZorn should have been moved to this pernicious activity Sam did notXknow: mere lack of friendliness hardly explained it. Zorn had spreadXthe story of the TrojanXXXs disaster, and had added a most unfavorableXversion of SamXXXs participation. He had worked on popular prejudiceXagainst both a cheat and a telltale. These things were to be regardedXas accomplished. The practical question remained, what was to be doneXabout them?XXSam had no ready answer to the question. The most he could do was toXcounsel prudence to the more radical and excitable of the club, urgeXall the members to watch carefully for anything which might have aXbearing upon the affair of the Trojan, and advise especially closeXstudy of the doings of Zorn, in an effort to discover, among otherXthings, the cause of his active enmity. On this point the other membersXof the club could give Sam little light. There had been no bitterXquarrel with Zorn; none of the boys could recall any ground for anXabiding grudge.XXAs was to be expected, the club drew closer together than ever. ItXformed hollow square, as it were, against all attacks. On its side, theXother faction showed no desire for reconciliation.XXSpring usually saw a series of inter-class baseball games. This yearXwas no exception to the rule; but none of the Safety Firsts playedXon the Junior nine. The Trojan, perhaps the best second baseman inXthe school, was passed over; Tom Orkney and Sam, both fair players,Xwere left out. Even the Shark, highly esteemed as an inerrant scorer,Xwas refused recognition. The slights were deliberate, inescapable,Xundeniable. And baseball was but one among many instances of theXfeeling of the majority of the class.XXOn the clubXXXs part all this was received defiantly. Cold shoulderXwas met by cold shoulder. Sam had no difficulty in keeping his chumsXin line. Orkney aided him greatly in the task of coaching the TrojanXin Latin, and added timely and encouraging suggestions, which wereXsorely needed. Still smarting under the sense of essentially unfairXtreatment, the Trojan would have been glad to quit the school. AgainXand again he rebelled at appearing at the recitations he was permittedXto attend, and it required all of SamXXXs tact and firmness and OrkneyXXXsXencouragement to hold him to his work under the existing conditions.XHerman Boyd also lent a hand occasionally, although he was not of muchXhelp as a tutor. As for the Shark, he went his way imperturbably. GiveXhim a sufficiency of his beloved mathematics, and he cared not a strawXfor the opinion of the multitude. Poke and Step had developed someXmysterious interest of their own, which kept them busy of afternoonsXin PokeXXXs barn. Sam asked no questions about their enterprise. If theyXwished to hold it a secret, he had no objections.XXSam, in these days, though, felt the double burden of responsibilityXand unpopularity. Lon Gates, who made it a business to observe himXclosely, noted his preoccupation and demanded the cause.XXXXXLetXXXs put our heads together, Sam,XXX he advised. XXXThey say itXXXs likeXlumps oXXX sugar in a cup oXXX coffee--twoXXXs betterXXXn one. Come now! OutXwith it!XXXXXSam hesitated. XXXI--I--whatXXXd be the use?XXXXXXXXDunno yet; thatXXXs for the pair of us to find out.XXXXXXXXBut----XXXXXXXXBut, to begin with,XXX said Lon briskly, XXXwhatXXXs Ed Zorn got againstXyou?XXXXXXXXEd Zorn? WhoXXXs been telling you? I didnXXXt let it out, did I?XXXXXXXXDunno what you may have been talkinXXX in your sleep, but IXXXll acquitXyou on what youXXXve said while awake.XXXXXXXXHow did you find out?XXXXXXXXMebbe I hainXXXt found much--IXXXd like to know jest how much. ThatXXXs whyXIXXXm cominXXX to headquarters and askinXXX you.XXXXXSam cherished independence, but at heart he welcomed this opening toXtalk things over.XXXXXTell me what youXXXve heard,XXX he suggested.XXXXXAfter you, sonny--mebbe,XXX said Lon. XXXFire ahead!XXXXXThen Sam told his story, Lon listening most attentively.XXXXXUmph! Fits like the two ends of a busted wish-bone,XXX he declared.XXXXXShow me your end, then,XXX urged Sam.XXXXXNo. You go on. YouXXXve said whatXXXs happened to your crowd. Now, whatXare you tryinXXX to have happen to other folks?XXXXXSam explained what the club had done. XXXWeXXXre sticking together, ofXcourse,XXX he added. XXXWeXXXre trying to keep the Trojan up to the mark.XXXXXXXXHard work?XXXXXSam grinned a little wryly. XXXIt isnXXXt as hard as it is going to be--IXcan see that clearly enough.XXXXXXXXGesso--itXXXs the stickinXXX part oXXX the plaster that worries--and thatXdoes the real good in the long run.XXXXXXXXBut you havenXXXt told your part of the story yet,XXX Sam pointed out.XXXXXXXXTainXXXt a whole lot. It merely bears out your notion that Zorn isXgunninXXX for you. But whatXXXs his reason?XXXXXXXXI donXXXt know,XXX Sam confessed. XXXWeXXXve been more or less on the outs,Xbut there was no trouble to justify such a grudge as he must have.XXXXXLon nodded. XXXMy notion, too--from what IXXXd picked up by scoutinXXX round.XAnd I have been seeinXXX and hearinXXX all there was to hear and see, Sam.XXXXXXXXWhatXXXs your theory, then?XXXXXXXXTheoryXXXs too strong a word--make it guess.XXXXXWell, my guess is that if I was goinXXX to prescribe for your case, IXXXdXdose you for politics--school politics. And if that guess is right,XI donXXXt wonder youXXXre worried. ItXXXs your fust attack, and a fellerXwith his fust touch oXXX politics is a good deal like a chap gettinXXXXacquainted with the hives--he feels as if he was in trouble all over.XXXXXSam grinned again. XXXYou talk as if youXXXd had experience, Lon.XXXXXXXXUmph! Guess I had! Run for third selectman once.XXXXXXXXAnd they beat you?XXXXXXXXThey didnXXXt--that was jest the difficulty. I learned fast enough. AndXI got enough. I was willinXXX to doff the spangles and retire to privateXlife after one term, I tell you!XXXXXXXXWhat happened to you?XXXXXXXXA-plenty! But itXXXs your case weXXXre discussinXXX. Now, if I hainXXXt forgotXall I ever knew about youngsters, there wouldnXXXt naterally XXXaXXX beenXall this stir and circus over a feller takinXXX a book where he hadnXXXtXoughter XXXaXXX took it--and there wouldnXXXt XXXaXXX been, either, all this fussXabout your givinXXX him away and turninXXX stateXXXs evidence, and----XXXXXXXXBut I didnXXXt,XXX Sam interrupted.XXXXXI know that well enough. So would the fellers in your class know it,Xif they stopped to think over the kind oXXX goods youXXXre made of. ButXthey ainXXXt stoppinXXX to think, because the somebody whoXXXs raisinXXX allXthe Cain is keepinXXX XXXem goinXXX. ItXXXs a heap like drivinXXX cattle. SoXlongXXXs theyXXXre kept on the move, theyXXXll tramp along, raisinXXX enoughXdust to keep XXXem from seeinXXX anything in particular. Same way withXhumans! The driver at your school is takinXXX care not to let the herdXstop and the dust settle. Pooty good manager, he is!XXXXXSam nodded. XXXYes--if you call it managing.XXXXXLon was silent for a moment. Then said he, gravely:XXXXXIXXXve been talkinXXX to you about politics. Now, thereXXXs good politics,Xand thereXXXs bad politics; but IXXXm mortal sure itXXXs bad politics youXXXreXfacinXXX. My tip jest backs up yours. I guess we can bank that betweenXXXXem weXXXre on the right track as to whoXXXs doinXXX things, even if weXdonXXXt know why heXXXs doinXXX XXXem. But, after all, that ainXXXt the mainXpXXXint--which is, what are you goinXXX to do about it?XXXXXXXXWhy--why, IXXXve tried to tell you.XXXXXXXXYouXXXve told more about what youXXXve done than about what youXXXre goinXXXXto do. So far, youXXXre all right, Sam. But whatXXXs the cominXXX program?XXXXXSam hesitated. XXXI--why, I suppose--I----XXX Then he had an inspiration.XXXXLook here, Lon! WhatXXXs your advice?XXXXXXXXStick to it!XXX said Lon emphatically. XXXHold your crowd up to the mark.XYouXXXre right; the other fellerXXXs wrong. HeXXXs bound to lose in theXend. If things didnXXXt work out that way in the long run, this oldXworld would XXXaXXX needed a XXXTenants wantedXXX sign back in the time oXXX theXcave-men. Fight it out, Sam; fight it out, if it takes all summer!XXXXXXXXLooks as if it might,XXX Sam confessed.XXLon dropped a hand on his shoulder. XXXYou stand to your guns, sonny!XAnd you make your club stand to theirs. Find something to amuse XXXem,Xsomething outdoors. IXXXm great on the open-air treatment.... LetXXXs see!XIf XXXtwas vacation, IXXXd say, go campinXXX. But, say! you can work a schemeXsorter in that line, anyhow. Why donXXXt you turn to and build a shack inXthe woods near town? OughtnXXXt to be too close--let XXXem have plenty ofXexercise, travelinXXX back and forth.XXXXXSam meditated briefly. XXXI--well, I do know of that cracking place--outXby the lake. ItXXXs pretty far, though.XXXXXXXXThatXXXs no objection--not for your purpose. Every time you walk XXXem aXmile, thereXXXs fifteen or twenty minutes used up that wonXXXt be put intoXmopinXXX. Get the idea?XXXXXXXXYes,XXX said Sam, XXXI do.XXXXXXXXXXXTainXXXt the wust I ever offered you, son.XXXXXXXXThe more I think of it, the better I like it,XXX said Sam; and departedXto offer LonXXXs suggestion to the other members of the club.XXThe Trojan received it with indifference. XXXI donXXXt care--IXXXm just aXpassenger,XXX he declared. Orkney at once said yes, and said it heartily.XHerman Boyd was ready for anything. The Shark had no objections toXinterpose. Then Sam sought out Poke, and found him in his barn, withXStep bearing him company.XXIt was not lost upon Sam that when the pair appeared, in answer to hisXhail, they took care to close the big door of the barn behind them. HeXplunged at once into his errand, and was a bit disappointed to noteXthat neither of the others displayed much enthusiasm.XXXXXOh, I guess itXXXll be all right--if you say so,XXX quoth Poke. XXXOfXcourse, weXXXre awfully busy, and thereXXXs lots to do, and--er--er--butXyou mostly know what youXXXre about, Sam.XXXXXXXXYes, but weXXXre mighty busy, you know,XXX contributed Step.XXSam glanced keenly at the pair. The hands of both were grimy, andXthere were certain greasy spots on their clothes, which stirred hisXcuriosity and reminded him of the mysterious occupation to which theyXhad been giving their spare time.XXXXXWhatXXXs up?XXX he demanded. XXXOut with it!XXXXXPoke glanced at Step, and Step shot an uneasy glance at Poke.XXXXXOh, if it is something you donXXXt care to talk about----XXX Sam began.XXPoke cleared his throat. XXXAhem, ahem! It--look here, Sam! It is a sortXof a secret, and yet I donXXXt know why we shouldnXXXt tell you. Course, weXwouldnXXXt want it gossiped all over town--we canXXXt have the crowd comingXhere and trying to get a sight of--of IT! But you--why, itXXXs differentXwith you, you know.XXXXXXXXAnd heXXXd have to find out sooner or later, anyway,XXX said Step, in aXstage whisper.XXXXXHe would--might as well tell him now,XXX responded Poke. XXXBut itXXXs to goXno farther,XXX he added, addressing Sam. XXXYouXXXll understand why, when IXtell you.XXXXXXXXFire ahead!XXX said Sam. XXXI canXXXt say I understand anything yet.XXXXXThere was no outsider in sight, but Poke lowered his voice.XXXXXYou remember that motor I bought? The one from the smashedXmachine--havenXXXt forgotten it, have you?XXXXXSam had not forgotten the incident of the purchase from Mr. Haskins,Xthough he had thought very little about it for some days.XXXXXWhat! That crazy deal?XXX he said. XXXWhatXXXs your game?XXXXXXXXYou may call the deal what you please,XXX said Poke with dignity, XXXbut IXwonXXXt admit it was crazy.XXXXXXXXNever mind that part of it. Go on, go on!XXX Sam urged. He wasXrecalling, not too distinctly, a story somebody had told him of seeingXPoke and Step driving into town with something carefully covered in theXback of their wagon. XXXGo on, I say! You fished the motor out of theXwreck, didnXXXt you, and brought it in?XXXXXXXXI did,XXX said Poke.XXXXXWe did,XXX Step corrected.XXXXXGot it here?XXXXXXXXYes,XXX said Poke and Step together.XXXXXWell, what are you going to do with it?XXXXXStep started to say something, and changed his mind. The result was anXextraordinary gasp. But Sam understood. Tempted as he was to proclaimXgreat news, Step was surrendering that honor to his chum.XXPoke drew a long breath. Then he spoke explosively:XXXXXFlying machine! WeXXXre making one!XXXXXThe reception of the sensational tidings should have satisfied PokeXXXsXyearning for dramatic effects. Sam dropped weakly upon a horse-block,Xwhich happened to be conveniently near. He stared at Poke blankly.XXXXXYou--_youXXXre_ making a--a flying machine!XXXXXXXXI am!XXX Poke declared promptly.XXXXXWe are,XXX Step hastened to amend.XXPoke nodded. XXXSure! ThatXXXs right. WeXXXre both in it.XXXXXXXXBut it was PokeXXXs idea,XXX testified Step generously.XXXXXMaybe, but Step has taken hold like a good fellow and helped a lot,XXXXaverred Poke, not to be outdone in fairness.XXSam waved an impatient hand. XXXThatXXXs all right. Tell me about theXmachine. What is it? Zeppelin?XXXXXXXXOf course not!XXX cried Poke. XXXZeppelin nothing! ItXXXll be a plane.XXXXXXXXMonoplane or biplane?XXXXXXXXWhy--why, weXXXre working on two or three plans. WeXXXll see which worksXout best. They say a monoplane is faster, and a biplane safer. WeXhavenXXXt settled all the details yet.XXXXXXXXGo ahead! Tell me some more.XXXXXXXXYes, let him have the whole thing,XXX Step advised.XXXXXWell, it was this way,XXX Poke explained. XXXYou know that day out by theXlake? When Haskins told us about the machine running away with him, heXmentioned that it had a mighty high-speed motor--one thatXXXd do in aXflying machine, he said. That set me thinking.XXXXXXXXPokeXXXs a crackerjack when it comes to that sort of thing,XXX StepXobserved admiringly.XXPoke modestly disregarded the tribute. XXXStruck me, Sam, there was myXchance. You know IXXXm in debt to all you fellows----XXXXXXXXNonsense!XXX Sam broke in. XXXWeXXXve told you to forget it.XXXXXXXXHowXXXs a fellow going to forget such things? I couldnXXXt, if IXwanted to. And I saw my chance. You know what they pay aviators forXexhibitions at county fairs and such places?XXXXXXXXNo! Do you?XXX Sam asked pointedly.XXXXXYes, sir, I do! Hundred dollars a crack! Read it in a paper.XXXXXXXXOh!XXXXXXXXWell, I saw the whole thing in a flash. If I got that high-speedXmotor and rigged up a plane, and learned to run it--why, two or threeXexhibitions would pay all my debts and put me on Easy Street. And thinkXof all the fun IXXXd have! And Step--he--well, minute I suggested it toXhim, he saw the whole thing just as clearly as I did.XXXXXXXXDonXXXt doubt he did,XXX said Sam.XXXXXSo he said heXXXd take hold and help. He did, and weXXXre workingXtogether. HeXXXll be entitled to a full share in the credit.XXXXXXXXExcept for inventing the idea, to begin with,XXX Step corrected.XXXXXOh, thereXXXll be glory enough for all,XXX said Poke easily.XXSam coughed. XXXH-g-h! I--I guess I understand. Say, though! Your folksXknow about all this?XXXXXXXXThey know weXXXre doing something in the barn. And they donXXXt care.XXXXXXXXSaid so, have they?XXXXXXXXWell, not--not exactly. But they havenXXXt tried to stop us. We donXXXtXkeep a horse now, you know, so they donXXXt have to come out this wayXoften. But they wouldnXXXt mind, anyway.XXXXXSam did not press the point. XXXLook here, Poke!XXX said he. XXXI donXXXtXknow much about flying machines, but the little I know makes me thinkXtheyXXXve got to be all right, or theyXXXll be all wrong. So, unless youXunderstand how to build XXXem----XXXXXXXXBut I do! Saw an article in a magazine and saved it. ItXXXs just full ofXdiagrams and dimensions and all that sort of thing.XXXXXXXXBut there must be problems of weights to be lifted--engine weight,Xyour weight, and so on. And youXXXve got to figure out the size of theXplanes to suit the load and the power.XXXXXPoke waved a lordly hand. XXXHumph! DonXXXt you suppose I know that? AndXdonXXXt you suppose IXXXm looking out for such details? Well, I am! YouXtrust your Uncle Dudley to be crafty in a thing like this!XXXXXXXXBut----XXX Sam began; then checked his speech. It was clear that PokeXand Step were committed to their amazing enterprise. On the strength ofXlong acquaintance with the pair he had no doubt that somehow or otherXthey would contrive to come to grief; but he failed to see that thereXwas anything he could do about it. Moreover, there were certain presentXadvantages to the Safety First Club in having two of its members soXthoroughly occupied.XXPoke wagged his head sagely. XXXDonXXXt think, Sam, that IXXXm going intoXthis thing blindfolded. ItXXXs a scientific scheme, and IXXXm putting itXthrough scientifically. Just you wait and see!XXXXXXXXAll right--IXXXll wait. But isnXXXt there anything to see yet?XXXXXThe others exchanged glances.XXXXXWhy--why, no,XXX said Poke. XXXYou can come in and take a look. Of course,XweXXXre messed up, but maybe you can get an idea of what weXXXre at.XXXXXSam followed him into the barn. Because doors were kept closed andXhorse blankets had been hung at windows to preserve secrecy, the placeXwas somewhat dim; but he made out the motor, set upon a pair of woodenXhorses, with a confusion of wrenches and other tools about it. In theXbackground was a gaunt framework of bamboo poles and wire.XXXXXFor the planes,XXX Poke explained. XXXWeXXXre still experimenting. But weXXXreXgetting there; we learn something every day.XXXXXSam made observation as closely as he could, but without greatXenlightenment.XXXXXWell, live and learn,XXX he remarked, non-committally. XXXAnd when do youXexpect to have the--er--er--the thing finished?XXXXXXXXOh, pretty soon,XXX Poke told him. XXXWeXXXre getting along faster thanXyouXXXd think. Step is a star at a job like this.XXXXXXXXWell, I do seem to be able to work out PokeXXXs ideas when he canXXXt doXit himself,XXX Step admitted.XXSam cleared his throat. XXXAhem, ahem! I--well, I guess my opinion isnXXXtXof much value, anyway. But thereXXXs something else I want to talk aboutXwith you fellows. Now, listen!XXX And he repeated, rapidly but clearly,Xthe project for a camp near the lake.XXStep did not appear to be impressed, but Poke was more responsive.XXXXXGreat scheme, Sam! Good sport! Besides, itXXXll give us a chance to haveXthe try-outs with the machine without a whole parcel of folks lookingXon and yawping. Those open fields this side of the woods by the lakeXwill be a bully place--nice and private and plenty of elbow room. Say,XIXXXm with you!XXXXXXXXThen I am, too, of course,XXX said Step. XXXWhenXXXll you start in?XXXXXXXXVery soon,XXX Sam told him.XXPoke furrowed his brow. XXXSay, IXXXm afraid we wonXXXt be able to help muchXat first; weXXXll be busy here, you know. But a little later----XXXXXXXXOh, thatXXXll be all right,XXX Sam hastened to assure him. XXXThe mainXthingXXXs to keep the club together.XXXXXXXXSure!XXX said the others in chorus.XXXXXAnd thatXXXs always the main thing,XXX Poke added heartily.XXXXXCHAPTER X SAM REJECTS A PROFFERED OLIVE BRANCHXXXOf a Saturday, bright and early, Sam and his followers set out forXthe lake. Only Poke and Step were missing, both having pleaded theirXexceedingly pressing duties as constructors of a flying machine, andXhaving agreed, readily enough, to endorse the othersXXX choice of a siteXfor the camp. The Trojan was in the party, hardly as a volunteer andXyet making no objection. The Shark marched along with his usual air ofXindifference, but Tom Orkney and Herman Boyd, who had some inkling ofXSamXXXs real problem and his efforts to solve it, showed both interestXand enthusiasm.XXLon had suggested a willingness to carry the club to the lake in theXbig car, but Sam had preferred a hike, it being his first care toXkeep his chums occupied. The day was fine, the sky clear, and theXmorning air fresh and invigorating. The single drawback was the dustXin the road. There had been no rain for several weeks, and thoughXthe conditions did not yet approach those of a drought, farmers andXgardeners were beginning to predict crop failures, unless a change cameXin the weather. To the boys, however, this danger did not make specialXappeal; and as the brightness of the spring foliage had not faded, theyXdeemed it a very pleasant day, indeed, and marched along at a briskXpace.XXOn the way there was more or less discussion of the charms of the lakeXdistrict, and the rival advantages of the two shores. Herman had aXtheory that it might be well to establish themselves near the pleasureXresort--not too near, of course, but near enough to hear the band whenXit played. Orkney was strongly for the greater privacy of the otherXside of the lake. The Trojan and the Shark expressed no preference, andXSam withheld his ideas on the subject.XXXXXWeXXXll scout all around,XXX he said. XXXThen we can pick the best spot.XWeXXXve plenty of time to make the right choice.XXXXXNow, scouting was a somewhat leisurely performance, and not a bad wayXof passing several hours. The country about the lake was rolling,Xwith a great deal of woodland--largely XXXsecond growthXXX hardwood, as isXfrequently the case when a pine and spruce country has been lumbered,Xand birches, oaks and maples come in to take the places of the fallenXgiants of the forest. In this case the lumbering had taken place soXlong ago that the new trees had attained considerable size, though theXXXXslashXXX left by the cutting (the litter of tops, limbs and broken treesXnot worth removal) was still much in evidence, offering dangerouslyXinflammable material, should a fire ever get a fair start in theXtract. Here and there, in the low spots between the ridges and littleXhills, the boys found swampy areas, where the undergrowth was thickXand tangled enough to suggest a jungle. On the side where the pavilionXand cottages were in course of erection something had been done inXthe way of clearing away the woods rubbish, but the club was agreedXthat the opposite shore had more natural advantages. Even Herman cameXover to this view at the consultation following luncheon; and thereXwas unanimity of opinion that the best site for a camp would be in theXneighborhood of the big Council Rock. Within fifty yards of the greatXstone was a glade where a tent could be pitched or a shack built; theXspring not far away was clear and bubbling; and, finally, between theXwoods and the road was an open field where Poke and Step could manXXuverXwith their flying machine.XXSam did not feel at liberty to explain to the others the remarkableXenterprise in which the pair were engaged, feeling that divulging theXgreat secret was the privilege of the young inventors; but in the talkXhe laid stress on the advantages of having open ground near by. To thisXsuggestion there was ready agreement. A chance for scrub baseball gamesXappealed to everybody, except perhaps the Shark; there might be evenXpossibilities of tennis. In the case of the after-luncheon discussionXthe club was prepared to admit that a generally more promising placeXfor a camp hardly could be desired.XXSam, with Poke and StepXXXs undertaking in mind, strolled away fromXthe group to study the fields with more care; and he was gazingXthoughtfully at the expanse of turf, when he heard a step behindXhim, and turned to see the Shark coming up. The spectacled youthXsaid nothing, but halted beside Sam and surveyed the open groundXdeliberately.XXXXXHow big is it--how many acres?XXX Sam asked, after a little. With theXclub it had come to be a habit to turn all calculations over to theXShark, as belonging in his special province.XXXXXHuh! What do you mean?XXX the Shark countered.XXSam waved a hand in a sweeping gesture. XXXWhy, all that--out there. HowXmuch room is there?XXXXXXXXClear ground or space within the fences?XXXXXXXXClear ground.XXXXXXXXTen acres, plus.XXXXXXXXOh!XXX said Sam. XXXThatXXXs quite a lot.XXXXXXXXHuh!XXXXXThere was an odd note in the SharkXXXs tone. Sam glanced at him keenly;Xsuspicion seized him that the other might have an inkling of what wasXin his mind.XXXXXI--IXXXm wondering if thereXXXs room for--well, for something,XXX he saidXsuggestively.XXThe Shark grunted. XXXUmph! SoXXXm IXXX; turned; stalked away. Sam chuckled.XHis suspicion was strengthened, but his liking for the Shark was notXlessened. Plainly that youth could keep a secret with the best of them.XXSam strolled on, crossing the field and coming to the road. ThereXhe paused for a little. A wagon loaded high with boards for the newXbuildings went creaking by; a farmer jogged along on his way back fromXtown; then a touring automobile, with much luggage in its tonneau, spedXby, raising a great cloud of dust. Plainly, there was a good deal ofXtraffic, of one sort or another, but Sam reflected comfortably that theXcamp would be far enough from the highway to escape its bustle.XXHe was about to turn back, when the sharp bark of a motorcycle caughtXhis ear, and in a moment more the machine shot around a bend in theXroad. It was traveling at a great pace, which slackened quickly whenXthe rider caught sight of the figure by the roadside. Sam could notXrepress a start of surprise. His eyes were good, and in spite of theXsemi-disguise of goggles and low-drawn cap he recognized Zorn, even asXhe perceived that the traveler intended to halt for parley.XXZorn stopped his machine abreast of Sam, hopped nimbly from his saddle,Xand dropped the support by which it could be held upright. He pushedXback his cap and pulled off his goggles.XXXXXParker, this is lucky,XXX he said. XXXIXXXve been wanting a chance to talkXthings over with you, when weXXXd be nice and private with nobody toXrubber.XXXXXSam met the overture coldly. XXXI donXXXt know that I want to talk to you.XXXXXZorn grinned. XXXWell, you canXXXt very well help yourself--unless you runXaway.XXXXXXXXOh, IXXXve things enough to say,XXX Sam responded sharply. XXXIXXXve just beenXwaiting for the right time.XXXXXXXXDonXXXt worry--this is it! NeverXXXll be a better time or place for whatXyouXXXre going to hear.... Look here! Had enough, have you?XXXXXSam stared at the other. XXXEnough? What are you driving at?XXXXXXXXYou oughtnXXXt to need maps. That election the other day proved that youXand your gang are done for--unless I lend you a hand.XXXXXXXXWhat kind of a hand?XXXXXZorn showed his teeth, though his speech was pacific. XXXA helping hand.XYouXXXre in bad--the lot of you.XXXXXXXXOh! Are we?XXXXXXXXYou are. The whole school believes youXXXre a crowd of cheats andXtattletales.XXXXXSam kept his temper, and that he did so was proof of the disciplineXhe had had in self-mastery. Moreover, it had flashed upon him that itXwas his business to learn, so far as he might, the purpose of ZornXin the campaign he had waged against the club. Purely as a matter ofXpreference he would have chosen to resort then and there to violence,Xbut a fight would cut short the explanation he so greatly desired. SoXhe said, quietly enough:XXXXXThereXXXs no truth in it. Nobody knows that better than you do.XXXXXXXXI know you gave Walker away.XXXXXXXXI had no such intention.XXXXXXXXAnd heXXXs under sentence for breaking rules and then lying about whatXheXXXd done.XXXXXXXXWalker neither broke rules nor lied.XXXXXZorn shrugged contemptuously. XXXOh, whatXXXs the use, Parker? You can singXthat song till youXXXre black in the face, and itXXXll do you no good.XYouXXXre in a hole, and you canXXXt get yourself or your crowd out. YouXXXveXgot to have the helping hand, I tell you, and IXXXm the only fellow whoXcan extend it to you.XXXXXXXXMeaning that as you started all the lies about us, nobody but you canXstop XXXem?XXXXXAt that Zorn scowled. XXXSee here, Parker! IXXXm not fussy, but if weXXXreXto do business, youXXXd better keep a civil tongue in your head. Cut outXthe XXXlieXXX foolishness! This thing didnXXXt require lying. You and WalkerXmanaged to mess things so, the plain record convicts you.XXXXXXXXThe record, as you call it, is wrong, mistaken.XXXXXXXXWhat if it is? It stands till itXXXs disproved. And whoXXXs going toXdisprove it? You canXXXt.XXXXXXXXCan you?XXX Sam shot back at him.XXXXXSure I can,XXX said Zorn coolly.XXXXXThen why donXXXt you?XXXXXXXXWhy should I? What have you or your push ever done for me?XXXXXSam checked the hot speech that trembled on his lips. XXXWait a minute,XZorn,XXX he said. XXXLet me get this straight. It sounds as if you wantedXto strike a bargain. Is that the idea?XXXXXXXXTo a dot! Fine! YouXXXre waking up!XXXXXXXXAnd if we do something for you, youXXXll clear the record for us?XYouXXXll go to all the people youXXXve told your story to, and youXXXllXtake it back? YouXXXll straighten out things for Trojan Walker with theXprincipal? YouXXXll tell who did the mean work, who took that book intoXthe examination, who----XXXXXZorn stopped him. XXXPull up, Parker! Suppose there was crookedXwork--suppose there wasnXXXt--suppose all the trouble came from a queerXaccident. IXXXm not saying which it was. All I am saying is that I canXfix your crowd and fix XXXem right--clean the slate for XXXem--all that.XWill you be sensible and make a trade?XXXXXXXXWhat kind of a trade?XXXXXZorn took a step nearer Sam, who was standing on the outer bank of theXnarrow roadside ditch. The movement brought the two boys very closeXtogether.XXXXXThis is straight talk--understand? I mean business.XXXXXXXXAll right,XXX said Sam. XXXGo on!XXXXXXXXIXXXll see the slateXXXs cleaned for you and your crowd, if----XXXXXXXXIf what?XXXXXXXXIf youXXXll do what I want you to do.XXXXXXXXAnd whatXXXs that?XXXXXXXXBack me up. IXXXve got some plans. You can help me--you and your gang.XYou can help me a lot.XXXXXXXXHow?XXX Sam shot the query at Zorn.XXZornXXXs answer was prompt enough; plainly, he had his ideas clearlyXformulated.XXXXXThe way to get a thing is to make up your mind just what you want andXthen go for it. Now, I want to be boss of the class and of the schoolXnext year--I donXXXt make any bones about it--to you.XXXXXSam smiled, a little grimly. XXXGo on,XXX he said.XXXXXTo be boss, IXXXve got to have backing. I need yours--and by yours IXmean your whole clubXXXs.XXXXXXXXBacking for what?XXXXXXXXWell, to begin with, thereXXXs the meeting to form a County Inter-SchoolXAthletic Association. One Junior will be on our schoolXXXs committee.XIXXXm after that job, and I want a practically unanimous election by theXclass. I can have it, if your crowd will swing into line. Then, thereXXXsXtalk of a school athletic council next year. If I land one, I can landXthe other, too. Then thereXXXs the Valley Debating League. It hasnXXXtXamounted to much lately, but I can get hold of it, and build it up.XAnd there are some other things--never mind them now, though; theyXXXllXnaturally follow the others.XXXXXSam stared at Zorn; there was more than a trace of amazement in hisXexpression.XXXXXWhew! but youXXXre scheming to be a regular Pooh-Bah! You want to be theXwhole thing!XXXXXZorn nodded coolly. XXXThatXXXs the ticket, Parker. No use pretendingXanything else. But there isnXXXt a thing IXXXve mentioned that I canXXXtXhave, if your club will play my game. I take off my hat to you forXthe way you hold your bunch together. WhatXXXs more, I know perfectlyXwell that youXXXve got a lot of influence in the class--and I want thatXinfluence. YouXXXre kind of down and out now, but, as IXXXve told you, IXcan put the lot of you back on your feet. ThatXXXs worth something, isnXXXtXit?XXXXXXXXYes,XXX said Sam quietly.XXZorn grinned. XXXGood! Now weXXXre coming down to business.XXXXXA fine line showed in SamXXXs forehead. XXXZorn, this means you want toXtrade on the fact you can clear the Trojan of charges of which heXisnXXXt guilty.XXXXXXXXThe Trojan and you, too. TheyXXXre more down on you--the class, IXmean--theyXXXre sorer on you, Parker, than they are on Walker.XXXXXXXXBecause of the lies--no; IXXXll call them reports--youXXXve spread?XXXXXXXXThatXXXs better.XXXXXXXXThen you own up you did make all the trouble? Just what did you tellXabout us?XXXXXXXXNever mind what I said. It was enough--and not too much.XXXXXXXXAnd you can say enough more to straighten everything out?XXXXXXXXThatXXXs right--youXXXve got the combination.XXXXXXXXWhat will you say?XXXXXXXXYouXXXll find out--the day you vote as I tell you to.XXXXXSamXXXs expression was growing more belligerent. XXXZorn, youXXXre aXmiserable skunk, but youXXXve trapped yourself. YouXXXve owned up youXpractically lied about us. When I tell that to folks----XXXXXXXXTell, and be hanged! What good will it do you? NobodyXXXll believe you!XXXXXXXXBut you said it!XXXXXAt that Zorn laughed. XXXHo, ho! Parker, youXXXre a mark, youXXXre easy!XWhereXXXll be your witnesses?XXXXXXXXYou mean, youXXXll deny it?XXXXXXXXSure! ThatXXXs the advantage of having nobody else around when youXXXreXtalking confidentially.XXXXXSam gasped. Here was a standard of conduct which was new to him.XXXXYou--you----XXXXXXXXOh, I wasnXXXt born yesterday,XXX Zorn interposed. XXXI know when to makeXspeeches to a crowd, and when to take XXXem one at a time. Nobody hasXheard what IXXXve told you to-day; you canXXXt bring witnesses. My word isXas good as yours--no; better. I havenXXXt got the school down on me. ButXthatXXXs not the first question, which is, will you do business?XXXXXXXXNo--not that sort of business!XXX Sam cried wrathfully.XXZorn scowled. XXXYouXXXre an idiot, then. I offer you a chance to getXyourself and your crowd in right again, and you wonXXXt have it, eh? WhatXdo you want? What do you propose to do?XXXXXXXXThrash you!XXX said Sam promptly. XXXThereXXXs a licking coming to you,XZorn, and after what youXXXve said to-day, itXXXs time you had it.XXXXXZorn laughed scornfully. XXXGuess IXXXll have something more to say aboutXthat, Parker. The fellow that can whip me doesnXXXt wear your shoes.XXXXX[Illustration: SAM BEGAN TO WRIGGLE OUT OF HIS JACKET]XXSam began to wriggle out of his jacket. XXXYou wait a minute, and weXXXllXsee about that!XXX he said curtly.XXBut Zorn didnXXXt wait. There was a second in which Sam, with his armsXstill held by the sleeves of his half-removed coat, was helplessXagainst attack. Zorn improved the chance, though by the schoolboyXcode he was violating all the principles of fair play. He struck SamXa vicious blow on the forehead. Under the impact Sam reeled; lost hisXfooting; slipped down the bank of the ditch, and measured his lengthXon the ground. As he struggled to his feet, and completed the task ofXfreeing himself from his coat, Zorn, who had sprung to his machine andXstarted his motor, was out of reach and retreating at speed.XXSam shouted a challenge to him to halt and accept combat. It isXdoubtful if Zorn heard his voice above the bark of the motor, but atXthat instant he turned in his saddle and waved a derisive farewell.XXXXXCHAPTER XI SAM HEARS OF THE SARACENXXXSam laid before his friends the story of ZornXXXs curious proposal,Xbut said nothing of the manner of his parting with the adversary.XNot that he was disposed to forget the treacherous blow; indeed, hisXdetermination some day to visit physical retribution upon the otherXwas stronger than ever, but he felt that there were more importantXand pressing questions to be answered before he could dispose of hisXpersonal feud with Zorn.XXThe offer made by Zorn puzzled the clan. How could he clean theXslate, as he had said? How could he establish, to the satisfactionXof the faculty, that the Trojan had not broken the rules? How couldXhe persuade the school that Sam had not been an intentional witnessXagainst Walker? The club held long and serious debate on these matters.XStep was of opinion that Zorn was acting in bad faith, and cared onlyXto secure the support of the club. This obtained, he would simply notXattempt to carry out his agreement.XXXXXWhy, heXXXd just snap his fingers at us and laugh in our faces,XXX StepXinsisted. XXXWhen we kicked, heXXXd call us easy marks and ask us what weXwere going to do about it. But if it ever comes to a vote, count meXagainst Ed Zorn, first, last and all the time.XXXXXPoke agreed with his chum. Zorn was bluffing, he argued. Herman BoydXappeared to be less certain that Zorn could do nothing to make good hisXoffer, but was no more disposed than were the others to accept it. TheXShark shrugged his shoulders.XXXXXHow can you figure this out?XXX he growled. XXXNo known quantities! AllXguesswork and say-so!XXXXXThe Trojan, who logically might have been expected to display mostXinterest in the proposal, was indifferent. The feeling that he had beenXtreated with gross unfairness was still strong with him, and made himXbitter to a degree which sometimes taxed even SamXXXs patience.XXOrkney had little to say; but, as Sam observed, was not inclinedXto regard Zorn as unable to carry out his proposal. Questioned inXprivate, Tom confessed a good deal of appreciation of ZornXXXs capacityXfor mischief.XXXXXIXXXve been picking up what I could about the stories that have beenXspread about the school,XXX Orkney explained, XXXand theyXXXre corkers, allXright! I donXXXt wonder weXXXre in bad. About one part truth and nine partsXfake--thatXXXs the way with them. But the grain of fact seems to save theXmass of falsehood. And theyXXXre clever and ingenious--thatXXXs what makesXit so hard to try to disprove them. So IXXXm sure Zorn is at the bottomXof the row, and just as sure that he knows what he is about, and hasXsome definite scheme he is following out. And if part of that schemeXcalls for undoing what heXXXs done--why, heXXXs the one fellow who can undoXit.XXXXXXXXBut how?XXX Sam queried.XXOrkney shook his head. XXXI donXXXt know. Mind you, he took care not toXgive you a line on his method. He said, didnXXXt he, that all the troubleXmight have come from a XXXqueer accidentXXX or from XXXcrooked workXXX--heXwasnXXXt saying which it was? Well, then! What he meant was that weXXXdXhave to deal with his offer blindfolded, as it were, and trust to hisXword. He was taking pains not to give you any more information than heXhad to give. It all fits in with the rest of his performance.XXXXXXXXBut youXXXre not for taking up with him?XXXXXXXXNot on your life!XXX said Tom curtly. XXXWeXXXll beat him yet, and weXXXllXbeat him without any low-down deals.XXXXXSam nodded. XXXThatXXXs my notion, too. Clever as he is, heXXXll make someXfalse step, or a breakXXXll come somewhere. You canXXXt beat the truth inXthe long run.XXXXXXXXYouXXXve said it!XXX Orkney agreed with conviction.XXSam laughed. XXXBut Lon said it first,XXX he remarked.XXFor all the boys it was a relief to turn from plots and intrigues toXthe good sport of planning and building the camp. Possibly the plansXwere more entertaining than their execution. Poke and Step left detailsXto the others, who put their heads together and discussed the rivalXmerits of a tent and a shack, and finally sought LonXXXs advice.XXLon, as it proved, favored a tent.XXXXXYou see, boys, youXXXre more or less transients,XXX he explained. XXXNow,XthereXXXll be some things thatXXXll be like the mumps--you canXXXt tell howXmuch theyXXXll bother till youXXXve had a go with XXXem. Take the XXXskeeters,Xfor instance. The old pond used to have a sight of XXXem, and you donXXXtXknow whether theyXXXve moved out jest because itXXXs been turned into aXlake. Then thereXXXs the fishinXXX. It used to be prime off the big rock,Xbut fish are notional as folks, and as freaky. Then, too, thereXXXs theXpermission to use the land--who owns that shore, anyway?XXXXXNone of the club could answer the question.XXXXXWell, youXXXd better find out,XXX Lon counseled. XXXCourse, in the oldXdays, if you wanted to put in a week or so in the woods, it was a caseXof move in and welcome, so longXXXs you behaved and didnXXXt cut growinXXXXtimber, and didnXXXt start forest fires----By the way, boys, thatXXXs aXthing youXXXll have to be careful about; itXXXs gettinXXX powerful tinderyXin the woods this dry spell. But nowadays weXXXre gettinXXX fashionable,Xand theyXXXre cuttinXXX up lots along the lake shore, and owners may beXfussy. So, seems to me I wouldnXXXt be making many permanent improvementsXanywhere till I found out whether I was goinXXX to be allowed to enjoyXthe use and usufruct oXXX the same.... Two dollars, please!XXXXXXXXWhat for?XXX the boys chorused.XXXXXMy fee for legal advice!XXX Lon chuckled. XXXRegXXXlar office rate, ainXXXtXit? Settle up!XXXXXXXXGuess youXXXll have to charge it,XXX Sam told him.XXXXXCanXXXt do that, but IXXXll drop out to the camp when youXXXre settled, andXtake it out in board and lodginXXXs.XXXXXXXXThatXXXs all right,XXX Sam declared. XXXBut weXXXll want to have you along,Xanyway.XXXXXXXXThen find out whose land youXXXre on, and get his permission. I allersXdid hate to be waked up at midnight and told to move on because I wasXtrespassinXXX.XXXXXXXXWeXXXll attend to it,XXX Sam said. It was good and sensible advice, and heXmeant to improve it; but, as it chanced, there was a difficulty in theXway. Division lines in wooded tracts are often very faintly indicated;Xeven neighborsXXX ideas on the subject are vague. Sam made inquiries;Xfailed to gain light; discovered nobody who offered objections, andXcame to the conclusion that a tent pitched near the big rock was notXlikely to lead to protest.XXTom Orkney had an old tent, somewhat in need of patches and repairs;XHerman Boyd produced the remnants of one still older but furnishingXmaterial for strengthening the other. The club massed its strength forXcutting and sewing, fitting fresh guy ropes and providing pegs. ThenXone afternoon Lon announced himself ready to transport the equipment toXthe lake, and Sam started out to round up his clan.XXOrkney, the Trojan and Herman were reached by telephone, but the SharkXwas not at home. Sam, descending upon the airship builders, found himXin consultation with Poke and Step. PokeXXXs barn was more than ever likeXa cavern of mystery. The blankets at the windows were drawn back forXthe sake of better light for the workers, but the confusion of tools,Xcans, motor parts and wire had multiplied since SamXXXs former visit. InXthe midst of it all loomed the framework of the wings.XXSam peered at the machine with lively curiosity.XXXXXHulloo! Going to make it a monoplane, are you?XXX said he. XXXWhen I wasXhere before you hadnXXXt decided.XXXXXPoke coughed, and glanced a bit nervously at the Shark. XXXAhem!XWhy--why, Sam, I guess the monoplane will work better, seeing theXkind of motor weXXXve got--high speed kind, you know. And the Shark--heXsays----XXXXXThe Shark emitted a sound. It was not a groan, nor a grunt, nor yet aXchuckle; but, somehow, it suggested all three. Sam turned to him.XXXXXThe other day I guessed you knew something about this, though you keptXyour own counsel--that day we were looking over the open field near theXlake.XXXXXXXXUmph! Then you guessed right.XXXXXXXXWhat do you think of the scheme?XXXXXXXXCrazy!XXX snapped the Shark.XXThere Poke intervened. XXXLet me explain, Sam! IXXXm not crazy, and theXscheme isnXXXt crazy. ThereXXXs a lot of mathematics in flying. ThatXXXs whyXI called in the Shark to figure out things for me. If anybody can doXit, he can. Now, you see, flying is just lifting a load in the air andXmoving ahead. To do that youXXXve got to apply power to a propeller. IXXXveXtold the Shark to calculate how many revolutions a minute the propellerXhas got to make to do the business for us, and what the plane spaceXshould be, and a few other little things like that.XXXXXXXXYes, thatXXXs all he wants me to tell him!XXX jeered the Shark.XXXXXWell, thatXXXs why brains like yours are put in anybodyXXXs head,XXX quothXPoke, philosophically.XXXXXAs if IXXXd ever specialized on aeronautics! Why, IXXXve got to dig theXwhole thing out!XXXXXXXXThen you havenXXXt given your opinion yet?XXX Sam asked.XXXXXOf course not!XXX cried the Shark; then he grinned. XXXI did tell Poke oneXthing, though. I showed him heXXXd made his first design of a plane soXwide he couldnXXXt get the contraption through the barn door, no matterXhow he turned it.XXXXXPokeXXXs face grew a rosy red. XXXOh, that! Well, I guess we did makeXa little miscalculation. But it didnXXXt matter. All weXXXve got to doXis to make up for reduced plane area by increasing the speed of theXmachine--speeding up the propeller and engine, you know.XXXXXXXXI donXXXt know,XXX said Sam. XXXIXXXll have to take your word for it.XXXXXXXXWell, IXXXm right about it. You see, the faster we fly, the bigger theXlift. IXXXve read that, and itXXXs plain as the nose of your face, anyway.XXXXXSam looked his doubts. XXXI should think there might be trouble inXincreasing the power indefinitely.XXXXXXXXOh, StepXXXs worked out a plan--have the propeller turn three times,Xsay, instead of two for every revolution of the engine--thatXXXs theXidea. I donXXXt know just the ratio--IXXXm leaving it to Step and theXShark. But itXXXll be all right. The SharkXXXs a wizard for figuring, andXStepXXXs a cracker jack on the mechanical end!XXXXXXXXWell, youXXXve got to do the best you can with things,XXX remarked StepXcomplacently.XXSam glanced at the motor. XXXHowXXXs the wreck working?XXX he inquired.XXXXXBully!XXX said Step.XXXXXPretty well,XXX was PokeXXXs verdict.XXXXXYou donXXXt agree very closely,XXX Sam commented.XXXXXOh, well, maybe she skips now and then,XXX Step admitted. XXXBut I--we,Xthat is--weXXXll have her humming like a top before long.XXXXXXXXYes, StepXXXll attend to that part of it,XXX said Poke confidently.XXThe Shark appeared to be tiring of the discussion; for he turned to theXdoor. Reminded of the afternoonXXXs business, Sam stopped him.XXXXXLonXXXs all ready to take us out to the lake. WeXXXll pitch camp beforeXnight.XXXXXXXXAll right! IXXXll go along,XXX said the Shark readily.XXXXXYou, too, Poke?XXXXXPoke and Step exchanged glances; then said the former, with a trace ofXreluctance:XXXXXWhy--why, I guess so. Course weXXXve got lots to do, but we want to holdXup our end with the rest of the club. So weXXXll come along, and let theXSaracen wait a while.XXXXXXXXThe Saracen?XXX Sam repeated.XXXXXConfound it, Poke! CanXXXt you keep anything to yourself?XXX Step criedXreproachfully.XXXXXOh, that just slipped out!XXX Poke said ruefully. XXXI didnXXXt mean to giveXit away. But XXXSaracenXXX is going to be the name of the machine. KindXof appropriate, donXXXt you think? You know you always picture SaracensXskimming around over deserts and--er--er--over things generally. AndXthatXXXll be the way weXXXll do. Understand?XXXXXXXXI do,XXX Sam assured him with all the gravity he could command.XXPokeXXXs expression betrayed relief. XXXI thought you would--youXXXve gotXall-XXXround brains, Sam. The Shark, now--course heXXXs got brains, of aXsort--and mighty good ones of a sort they are--but while heXXXs a corkerXat figuring, he canXXXt seem to rise to the--to the--well, to the romanceXand poetry of a thing like this.XXXXXThe Shark shrugged. XXXIXXXd be stronger for this Saracen business, maybe,Xif there was a desert or two handy.XXXXXSam was enjoying the conversation, but time was slipping away. HeXjoined the Shark by the door.XXXXXYou fellowsXXXd better hurry up,XXX he said to Poke and Step. XXXCome overXto the house. Lon and the car will be waiting.XXXXXXXXAll right! WeXXXll come,XXX they answered together; and Sam, taking theXSharkXXXs arm, marched him off.XXXXXCHAPTER XII CONCERNING TROUT AND OTHER THINGSXXXThe boys of the club stretched themselves out, very much at theirXease, with the glowing embers of a camp-fire in the center of theirXcircle. The tent was pitched and made securely fast to well-drivenXpegs; a ditch was dug about it to take care of surplus water in caseXof a rain; in one corner was a shake-down of spruce boughs, artfullyXinterwoven into a thick, elastic mattress, which promised a restful bedXin case any of the party chose to remain over night in camp. Poke hadXspent two hours in bringing stones from the lake shore and buildingXa fireplace to his satisfaction. Orkney had cleared a path from theXglade to the beach. The Trojan and Herman Boyd had stacked a noble pileXof fire-wood. Indeed, everybody had been remarkably busy through theXafternoon, and had brought a wonderful appetite to supper, when lunchXbaskets were unpacked, and a coffee-pot sent forth delicious odors toXmingle with those others which come only from bacon frying to a turn inXskilful open air cookery. And then there had been the trout! But thatXwas almost a story by itself.XXSam had wondered a bit that Lon, instead of aiding in the work,Xdisappeared soon after the party reached its destination. And Lon wasXgone for hours. He came back, with a rod (cut from a thicket) overXhis shoulder and a string of trout, at sight of which the boys raisedXa shout. They rained inquiries upon him. How many had he caught?XWhere had he found them? Would he show them the brooks? Trout, be itXunderstood, were much sought by anglers thereabouts, and such a XXXmessXXXXas Lon had caught was a rarity. But Lon, though much importuned, merelyXshook his head and laughed. HeXXXd caught his trout XXXover there,XXX heXsaid, giving the boys the traditional answer of the lucky fisherman.XWould he guide them to the brooks? That depended. HeXXXd see--some day,Xperhaps--meanwhile, here were some fine fish to be cooked and eatenXbefore they lost their freshness. And as for the cooking--well, LonXcalled attention to the fortunate chance that he had brought along aXspecial frying-pan, and a piece of pork, and some meal; and modestlyXremarked that he was something of a chef himself when it came toXdealing with trout just out of their native waters. As he more thanXmade good his statement, it was a very toothsome as well as a veryXmerry supper to which the club gave its undivided attention.XXThen came the leisurely hour about the fire. In the early twilight ofXthe long spring day, when the shadows were thickening under the treesXand the air was taking a hint of crispness, it was good to draw closeXto the glowing bed of coals and snuggling comfortably in jacket orXsweater, chat lightly of the dayXXXs incidents and plan improvements inXthe camp and expeditions about the surrounding country. Lon, with hisXback against a stump, was a picture of contentment.XXXXXTell you, boys, this is the life!XXX he said. XXXIXXXd live it all theXwhile, if XXXtwaXXXnXXXt for jest one little drawback.XXXXXXXXWhatXXXs that, Lon?XXX Step demanded.XXXXXThe need oXXX gettinXXX three square meals a day. Somehow, my constitutionXseems to require XXXem. ItXXXs funny, but XXXlong about seven in theXmorninXXX, and again at noon, and once more near sundown I begin toXget that gone feelinXXX under the belt. And when it comes to supplyinXXXXvictuals regXXXlar, the woods ainXXXt in it with what us poets call theXhaunts oXXX man. ItXXXs a pity itXXXs true, as we say in rhyme.XXXXXXXXBut that isnXXXt a rhyme.XXXXXXXXItXXXs part of one, anyhow. DonXXXt expect me to give you a wholeXrecitation, do you?XXXXXXXXIXXXd rather hear where you caught those trout.XXXXXXXXThatXXXs tellinXXX.XXXXXXXXOh, well, IXXXve seen bigger ones,XXX said Sam mischievously.XXXXXHumph! soXXXve I,XXX Lon agreed placidly.XXXXXMy uncle got a two-and-a-half-pounder once--I saw it,XXX PokeXcontributed.XXXXXSquare-tail?XXX asked Herman.XXXXXSure!XXXXXXXXThen it had run into some pond.XXXXXXXXNo; he caught it in a brook.XXXXXXXXIXXXve heard of them as big as that,XXX said the Trojan.XXXXXFellow last year was showing one that was over three pounds--brookXtrout, too,XXX declared Step.XXTom Orkney shook his head. XXXI know, I know! You hear such yarns, but,Xsomehow, the proof isnXXXt conclusive. And if youXXXre talking about theXgenuine native trout, and not about some of the imported varieties thatXhave been used to stock the streams----XXXXXThere he was interrupted by two or three, speaking at once. XXXI tellXyou those big fellows are pond fish!XXX XXXThe nativeXXXs the best of theXlot, but he wonXXXt grow so big!XXX XXXItXXXs all a question of food supply--myXfather says so!XXXXXTom chose to accept none of the challenges. Instead, he turned to Lon.XXXXXLook here! YouXXXve fished all the streams around here. What do you sayXabout it?XXXXXXXXI ainXXXt sayinXXX, son. I ainXXXt quite sure whatXXXs the question before theXhouse.XXXXXXXXItXXXs how big will a brook trout grow--in a brook?XXXXXXXXI donXXXt know.XXXXXXXXBut you must have some idea,XXX Tom urged. XXXWhatXXXs the biggest you everXsaw?XXXXXXXXIt was so big IXXXd hate to say jest how big it was.XXXXXXXXI donXXXt understand.XXXXXLon deliberated a moment, while the boys, getting hint of a story, drewXcloser.XXXXXWell, I say I saw the big fellow, but thatXXXs sort oXXX misleadinXXX. IXdidnXXXt see well enough to go to measurinXXX or estimatinXXX in feet andXinches, or in pounds, for that matter. But I did see Old Man FreemanXXXsXWilliam Trout, and he was a buster, I tell ye!XXXXXXXXFreemanXXXs William Trout?XXX Sam repeated. XXXWhatXXXs that? A species?XXXXXXXXNope--straight brook trout. Leastwise, Old Man Freeman said so.XXXXXXXXSeems to me IXXXve heard of Freeman,XXX Poke put in. XXXGuess my father knewXabout him.XXXXXXXXLikelier your grandfather. XXXTwas a good ways back when he flourished.XI was a little shaver fust off in our acquaintance.XXXXXXXXLetXXXs have the story!XXX cried Step.XXXXXYes--the story!XXX echoed Poke.XXXXXWell, I ainXXXt got my notes with me, but IXXXll do my best to entertainXthe company,XXX said Lon. XXXWay of it was this: When I was the age ofXyou chaps--no; I guess XXXtwas when I was a size smaller--there wasnXXXtXanything IXXXd rather do than get out on a good brook XXXlong in theXspring. And there waXXXnXXXt many brooks in my part oXXX the country that IXdidnXXXt try to see if they was good or not. So that was how, workinXXXXalong a stream way back in the hills one day, I stumbled on Old ManXFreemanXXXs place.XXXXXIt was a new brook to me, and there was a lot of woods, so I was doinXXXXa heap oXXX wadinXXX, the brook beinXXX the nearest thing to a path thereXwas. I wasnXXXt payinXXX much attention to the scenery, and I guess I plumbXforgot it when I come to jest about the most promisinXXX lookinXXX pool youXever sot eyes on. But I hadnXXXt moreXXXn dropped in my hook when thereXwas a roar like a bullXXXs, and a wild old codger was rushinXXX at me.XHe grabbed me by the collar, and yanked me up the bank, and began toXshake my back teeth loose. Course, I wriggled and fit like a cat, butXXXXtwaXXXnXXXt no use. Mebbe that was so plain it kinder reminded him whatXa little fellow I was, for, after a while, he quit treatinXXX me like aXbottle oXXX medicine before takinXXX, and stopped to have a good look atXme. Then he asked me, mighty sharp, what in tarnation I meant by tryinXXXXto catch his pet trout Bill, and why I didnXXXt stay home and tend to myXown business, or couldnXXXt my folks find nothinXXX for me to do.XXXXXWell, I got back breath enough to say that I didnXXXt mean no harm, andXIXXXd never heard tell oXXX his Bill, and if he didnXXXt leggo oXXX me heXXXd beXsorry--you know the kind oXXX oratory a youngster puts up in a case likeXthat. I guess it didnXXXt skeer him none; but it gave him a chance toXlook me over some more. All of a sudden he says, XXXBoy, you watch sharp,Xand you wonXXXt have to have nobody tell you about Old Man FreemanXXXsXBill. Now look!XXXXXXXXThen he lets go my collar, and steps forward, and bends over theXwater, and pats it two-three times with his cupped hand. And thereXXXs aXswish and a swirl, and something comes shootinXXX across the pool. AndXthe somethingXXXs the biggest trout IXXXd ever see or ever dreamed of.XNot that I made him out like print, as you might say--I couldnXXXt tellXjest where he began or where he ended, but in between them pXXXints wasXa mighty lot oXXX concentrated trout. He whirled around the old manXXXsXhand--playinXXX tag with him, by jingo!--and then he shot back across theXpool like a streak oXXX fish lightninXXX.XXXXXI guess I gave a gasp like a fish out oXXX water. XXXMy eye, Mister,XXX saysXI, XXXbut heXXXs biggerXXXn I be!XXXXXXXXNow, a jokeXXXs like the measles; you never can tell how good itXXXs goinXXXXto take hold; sometimes itXXXs jest a flat failure like a case oXXX mockXmeasles. Then again itXXXs the real thing. That was the way with Old ManXFreeman. Somehow IXXXd hit his funny bone, and hit it hard. He looked atXme for a minute, his face creasinXXX crosswise till I thought the skinXXXdXcrack. And then he hawhawed. Boys, I tell you, I never heard such aXlaugh before! It fair creaked, his laughinXXX machinery was so rusty fromXlack oXXX use! And he shook till I thought his old clothesXXXd drop offXhim. But that laugh did a lot. It made me and Old Man Freeman friendsXfor life.XXXXXXXXBut didnXXXt he tell you how much his trout weighed?XXX Poke demanded.XXLon shook his head. XXXHe didnXXXt; for he didnXXXt know. He didnXXXt have noXmore scales than a hornpout.XXXXXXXXYou mean the big trout didnXXXt?XXXXXXXXI mean Old Man Freeman. He didnXXXt have many oXXX what youXXXd callXluxuries. Fact is, he lived like a hermit in a cabin beside the brook.XHe trapped some, and raised a few vegetables, and got along somehow.XHeXXXd no kith or kin, so farXXXs I ever heard of. And about his onlyXinterest in life was his Bill Trout. HeXXXd sit beside the pool, andXtalk to that fish sameXXXs if he was a human. And he fed him--oh, yes;XBill didnXXXt go hungry if Old Man Freeman did. Later on I found thatXif I wanted to be real popular, the way to do it was to bring along aXcouple oXXX pound oXXX liver for Bill Trout. And Bill seemed to understandXa heap--for a fish. HeXXXd let the old man pet him; and he got so heXdidnXXXt mind havinXXX me around, though we never got what youXXXd call realXfamiliar.XXXXXXXXBut youXXXre not giving us much light on how much a trout can weigh,XXXXSam objected, as Lon paused.XXXXXWell, for one thing, I ainXXXt quite through with the story. HappenedXthere was a long spell when I couldnXXXt go to see Old Man Freeman. I wasXdown country, workinXXX. Must XXXaXXX been all of five-six years before IXgot out to the cabin. The old man didnXXXt know me fust off, IXXXd growedXso. Fact is, he come at me mighty hostile with a shotgun; but when IXXXdXpersuaded him I was jest a small boy shot up a foot or two, he allowedXI didnXXXt need no more shootinXXX, and was real glad to see me.XXXXXXXXAnd whatXXXs become oXXX Bill?XXX says I. XXXHanginXXX round the place yet, isXhe?XXXXXXXXXXXWilliam Trout is very well, thanky; if itXXXs him youXXXre alludinXXX to,XXXXsays the old codger, mighty solemn.XXXXXXXXWilliam Trout?XXX says I, kinder questioning.XXXXXXXXYes, William,XXX says he, wagginXXX his head like a good fellow. XXXItXainXXXt fittinXXX and proper to be puttinXXX no nicknames on a fish oXXX hisXheft and traininXXX. But come along and take a look at William.XXXXXXXXWell, we went down to the pool, and Old Man Freeman cupped his handXand slapped the water. There was a sunbeam pourinXXX down through aXbreak in the leaves overhead, and hittinXXX the water so that right inXthe middle was a space all bright and shininXXX, and around it a band ofXstill and shadowy surface. The big trout must XXXaXXX been feelinXXX hisXoats that day, for as he shot out of the shadow and into the brightnessXhe gave a leap. Jerusalem! Talk about prisms and rainbows! There heXwas for jest a second, archinXXX like the bow and blazinXXX like a sunset,Xwith the gleaminXXX drops fallinXXX from him in a shower of jewels. Then,Xsplash! He was under again, and the water near the old manXXXs hand wasXa boilinXXX swirl. This time I didnXXXt even gasp. I hadnXXXt breath enoughXleft. I jest stood there, shakinXXX.XXXXXXXXBut how big was he?XXX persisted Poke.XXLon hesitated an instant. XXXI--well, I ainXXXt sayinXXX what my guess wouldXbe--and itXXXd have to be a guess. If I told the whole truth--or what IXbelieveXXXs the truth--none oXXX youXXXd believe me. I dunnoXXXs Ananias everXwent fishinXXX, but thereXXXs them asXXXd figger heXXXd XXXaXXX had a special giftXthat way. And I never sot out to qualify in the Ananias class.XXXXXXXXBut you must have some notion?XXXXXXXXYes; I have a notion,XXX Lon said slowly. XXXItXXXs a notion that IXXXve seenXXXXlakersXXX paraded as big fish that werenXXXt as husky chaps as Old ManXFreemanXXXs square-tail William Trout. But thatXXXs as fur as IXXXll go.XXXXXThere was a momentXXXs silence in the group about the fire. Sam ended it.XXXXXIXXXve heard my father say size was pretty much a matter of conditions.XSo, with the right conditions, I suppose a brook trout could do prettyXwell.XXXXXLon nodded. XXXThatXXXs about it, Sam. And William Trout was a regXXXlarXparlor boarder. He lived in a natXXXral trout brook, which means a brookXthat yields trout food; then Old Man Freeman kept fattinXXX up hisXrations. So he had nothinXXX to do but keep on growinXXX and growinXXX.XXXXXXXXBut I should think somebodyXXXd have caught him,XXX Step put in.XXXXXThe old man stood guard. HeXXXd posted his land with XXXNo fishinXXXXXX signs,Xand he was runninXXX a shotgun quarantine to boot. Fact is, he pepperedXtwo-three trespassers with birdshot, and after that got to be known heXwasnXXXt bothered much.XXXXXXXXBut why did the fish stay in the pool? Why didnXXXt he run down streamXor up?XXXXXLon chuckled. XXXThat was where Old Man Freeman figgered again. He likedXto let on that William Trout lingered from pure affection for him, butXI noticed that what with rocks and wire there was a fairly effectiveXfish-screen below the pool. It didnXXXt show much, but it was there. AndXthere was another a lot like it higher up. No; the big trout was cagedXall right. And that, I reckon, was why Old Man Freeman come to be deadXwhere they found him.XXXXXXXXGo on! Tell us!XXX cried two or three together.XXXXXWell, that summer I was out to see the old man half a dozen times. HeXwas growinXXX mighty stiff and feeble, and more obstinate and notionalXabout William Trout. HeXXXd sit on the bank for hours, mumblinXXX toXhimself and talkinXXX to that fish. And William--he was livelierXXXn aXcricket, but, somehow, I never seemed to get a chance to look himXover, cool and calculatinXXX. The old man let on he was worryinXXX aboutXwhatXXXd happen to William, if he should be took sick, allowinXXX that theXcritterXXXd die of a broken heart or some such foolishness. I tried toXcheer him up, but it didnXXXt do no good. WilliamXXXd pine and waste away,Xand that was all there was to it. But one day, when I heard that OldXMan Freeman was dead, and that somebodyXXXd found him lyinXXX between theXbrook and his cabin, and when I went out to the place--well, IXXXll ownXup I took a look for William Trout. I couldnXXXt spy him nowhere in theXpool. I cupped the water, but he didnXXXt come. Then I prodded aroundXwith a pole, and still no William! That sot me thinkinXXX. I moseyedXdown to the screen below the pool, and sure enough, the wires was cut.XI reckoned I knew what had happened. The old man must XXXaXXX felt theXlast attack cominXXX on, and used up what strength he had gettinXXX to theXwire and clearinXXX a way for William to scoot--he didnXXXt mean to haveXno fellow with a net scoopinXXX up the big fish and never givinXXX him aXchance. And William, he found the gap, and vamoosed; and the old man,Xhe tried to get back to the cabin, and dropped half-way. So that wasXthe end of the story for both of them, so far as I ever heard tell.XXXXXXXXBut didnXXXt anybody ever catch the big trout?XXX queried Step.XXXXXEnough tried--they fair wore a path along the bank below the pool;Xbut nobody landed William. There were a couple oXXX ponds the brook runXthrough, and he might XXXaXXX stayed in one of XXXem, or then again he mightXXXXaXXX navigated right through to the big river. Anyhow, he dropped out oXXXXsight, and stayed out. And thatXXXs the end of the story. And the moralXof it? Well, I dunnoXXXs thereXXXs any moral, exactly, except that youXcanXXXt get me to say how big a brook trout can grow.XXXXXXXXWhereXXXs the brook he lived in?XXX asked Poke.XXXXXOh, over there!XXX Lon said, and jerked a thumb over his shoulder. XXXSomeXways off. And XXXtwouldnXXXt interest you boys now--there ainXXXt no moreXWilliam Trouts in it.XXX Then he rose to his feet, and his tone changed.XXXXLook here, youngsters! Time we was movinXXX along, if you donXXXt expectXto put up here over night. You get me yarninXXX about my misspent youth,Xand I donXXXt notice how late itXXXs gettinXXX to be.XXXXXThe club followed his example, and rose, not too willingly. The duskXhad deepened, but it was still very pleasant to lounge about the dyingXfire.XXXXXWell, I suppose weXXXll have to go back to town,XXX Sam said reluctantly.XXXXThereXXXs school in the morning, as usual.XXXXXXXXThatXXXs so--worse luck!XXX growled Step.XXLon began to kick dirt upon the embers.XXXXXNo use takinXXX unnecessary chances,XXX he remarked. XXXItXXXs powerful dry inXthe woods just now, and you never can tell whatXXXd happen if a breezeXshould spring up and find a spark to carry. And this ainXXXt a goodXcountry to fight a healthy forest fire in. Too much truck jest waitinXXXXto burn, I tell you!XXXXXXXXHuh! IXXXd like to see a good, ripping old fire once,XXX said Step. XXXIXXXveXnever had the luck to be close to one.XXXXXXXXThen youXXXve been luckier than you know,XXX said Lon drily, and sent aXshower of dust upon the coals.XXXXXCHAPTER XIII PLAYING THE GAMEXXXThe camp at the lake very quickly proved its value to Sam and hisXfriends. It gave them a place of resort, an occupation. Poke and StepXcontinued to be absorbed in the construction of their aeroplane, butXthe others were glad to have an excuse for a hike, or an overnight stayXunder canvas, or a week-end outing. Gradually they were adding to theXequipment; and were making a comfortable nest in the woods. PossiblyXtheir zeal was increased by the fact that their relations with the restXof the class showed no improvement.XXPrivately, Sam speculated a good deal about this. In his experienceXschool disputes had a way of wearing themselves out, so to speak. ItXwas quite true that the Safety First Club was not making overtures toXthe others; but ordinarily in the boy-world, as he knew it, somethingXwould happen to make everybody forget temporarily causes of offense andXleave feuds a little dulled. In this instance, though, there were noXamicable interludes. What might be called a state of armed neutralityXcontinued. Sam, meditating, reached the conclusion that Zorn was stillXtaking the trouble to circulate his stories to the discredit of theXclub.XXIn one way or another, Sam chanced to see little of Zorn for a week orXtwo after their roadside interview. He was still urging his chums toXkeep a close watch upon the doings of the enemy, but none of them madeXdiscoveries throwing light upon the problem Zorn offered.XXThe Trojan continued to demand SamXXXs vigilance. He had reached a sortXof acceptance of the situation, and with the coaching of his friendsXin Latin was keeping up his classwork, after a fashion; but there wasXno heart in his performance. The sense of suffering from injusticeXrankled, and whatever he did was because of his promise to Sam ratherXthan because of desire to hold his place in the school.XXLon, in these days, was a tower of strength to Sam. He was shrewd andXobservant, and really understood the position of the club and itsXdifficulties.XXXXXKeep at it; play the game!XXX was his advice. XXXI donXXXt go to say itXXXsXthe best game you could have picked out; but then, again, I ainXXXtXsayinXXX itXXXs the wust. And with any game I ever see or heard tell on,Xthe only thing to do was to play it honest and play it through, andXkeep your eyes open and learn what the gameXXXll teach you. The one thingXthat sure ainXXXt got no use or profit in it is wobblinXXX, and shiftinXXX,Xand changinXXX your mind back and forth like a feller experimentinXXX withXhis fust pair oXXX shoes thatXXXs rights and lefts. ThatXXXs what I saysXto Poke the other day, when he had me over to take a squint at thatXblessed Scary Hen oXXX his.XXXXXXXXXXXScary Hen?XXXXXX Sam repeated dubiously.XXXXXYep! That bird contrivance heXXXs putting together.XXXXXXXXOh, you mean his Saracen,XXX said Sam, enlightened.XXLon nodded. XXXIXXXm callinXXX it the Scary Hen--I do love a name that fits!XYou see, he had me in, sort oXXX consultinXXX engineer-like, to paw overXthat old motor he acquired from Philanthropist Haskins. ItXXXs sure someXengine!XXXXXXXXBut it never will work, will it--for PokeXXXs purposes, I mean?XXXXXLon rubbed his chin. XXXWell, I dunno. Somehow, way IXXXm built in mindXand body, I kinder fancy having a foot or a wheel touchinXXX ground. IXnever was intended to scoot round, bumpinXXX the birds. So mebbe IXXXmXprejudiced, when it comes to flyinXXX machines. But that old motor--well,XitXXXs an antique, all right, and itXXXs got trimminXXXs I hainXXXt seen inXyears, and I reckon itXXXs a gasoline hog for keeps, but XXXtis high speed,Xsure enough. LikelyXXXs not XXXtwas made for some old-time racinXXX car. AndXI will say Poke or Step, one of XXXem, has got a knack with machinery;Xfor theyXXXve got Methusaleh to workinXXX so well that I wouldnXXXt trustXmyself behind him, if he was rigged in a road roller. But as for whatXthey will do with the power theyXXXre generatinXXX, and the schemes theyXXXveXfiggered out to twirl the propeller--say, that sort oXXX stuff is allXoff my beat. I did give XXXem a hint or two about changinXXX wirinXXX, butXthere I stopped. And as for the name of the contraption--say, now, Sam!Xif those boys donXXXt scare the feathers off every hen in ten mile, IXXXmXmissinXXX my guess. That motorXXXll work fast enough, but it coughs like aXmillion chokinXXX dogs, and the way it misses fire now and then--whew!Xbut itXXXs enough to make a man or a rooster jump out of his skin! ButXPoke says mufflers are barred on flyinXXX machines, and so there youXare! YouXXXve got to be in the fashion if you bust all the neighborsXXXXear-drums.XXXXXSam, who had no confidence in PokeXXXs great experiment, next consultedXthe Shark, whom he found to be pessimistic, but guarded in statement.XXXXXI havenXXXt got it worked out yet for Poke,XXX he said, XXXand until IXfinish the calculation, IXXXm not going to open my head, except to remarkXthat I guess most flyers have to make a lot of tests and take someXtumbles before they soar. Just now, though, IXXXm trying to find out justXwhat will happen when a given propeller turns a given number of timesXin a second and thereXXXs a given area of plane. I donXXXt know yet, butXIXXXm going to know.XXXXXWell as he knew the Shark and highly as he respected his mathematicalXtalents, Sam was impressed.XXXXXGeeminy! But thatXXXs a stunt youXXXve set yourself!XXXXXXXXCertainly it is,XXX said the Shark calmly. XXXIf it wasnXXXt one, I wouldnXXXtXbother with it. IXXXd never dabbled in aeronautics, you know, and itXXXsXmore or less of a job to look up the formulXX. No; if it wasnXXXt for theXsport of calculating----XXXXXXXXSport!XXX Sam interrupted, incredulously.XXXXXBest ever!XXXXXXXXWell, itXXXs all in the way you look at it. And--er--er--one manXXXs meatXis another manXXXs poison.XXXXXXXXCourse!XXX the Shark shrugged. XXXAnd if I didnXXXt find the game worth theXcandle, you donXXXt think, do you, that IXXXd be fussing with this schemeXof PokeXXXs? ThereXXXd be a deal easier way to answer the question whetherXor not his machine would fly--the empirical way.XXXXXXXXEh? WhatXXXs that?XXXXXXXXLet him try to fly and see what happens.XXXXXXXXBut he might break his neck.XXXXXXXXWell, heXXXd have the answer then, wouldnXXXt he?XXXXXXXXMaybe--but it wouldnXXXt do him much good.XXXXXXXXTrue--but the question would be answered,XXX observed the Shark,Xunemotionally. XXXThatXXXs the main point of interest.XXXXXSam did not think it worth while to dispute the assertion. Instead, heXleft the Shark to his calculations, and hied him to PokeXXXs barn.XXThere a glance revealed much apparent progress. Motor and plane hadXbeen brought together--assembled, as Poke hastened to explain.XXXXXIf this were a boat, weXXXd be ready for dock trials,XXX said he. XXXThatXXXllXshow you how far weXXXve got along.XXXXXXXXWhy donXXXt you make it one of the boat kind--hydro-aeroplanes, arenXXXtXthey?XXX Sam asked. XXXThen, if you fell into the water----XXXXXXXXShucks! I donXXXt intend to fall,XXX Poke put in hastily. XXXAnd thereXXXdXbe no use in pontoon attachments. IXXXm going to do my flying at fairsXmostly, where there wouldnXXXt be any ponds handy; for fairs are whereXthe money will be, and IXXXm out for the cash.XXXXXXXXOh! I remember,XXX said Sam, and drew closer to inspect the machine.XXThe contrivance was supported on bicycle wheels. The use of these andXof the planes--Poke appeared to have decided on a biplane model--SamXunderstood in a general way, but he was all at sea about the functionsXof various levers and cords grouped about the operatorXXXs seat, aXbicycle saddle fitted with a back and perched not too securely, by hisXnotion, on the framework. It occurred to the visitor that the spread ofXwing was not so great as he had supposed it would have to be; and heXventured a remark to this effect.XXPoke waved a careless hand. XXXOh, thatXXXs all right--increased speed ofXmotor has XXXtended to that difficulty. DonXXXt you worry, Sam!XXXXXSam said nothing, but moved slowly around the machine, eyeing itXclosely.XXXXXIXXXd give you a demonstration--kind of a drill, that is,XXX said Poke,XXXXif all the rigging were complete. But it isnXXXt, quite. Step, you see,Xis working out the details--heXXXs a crackerjack of a mechanic--regularXgenius. Just now some of his ideas are sort of--well, sort of inXembryo--and things arenXXXt fixed just the way theyXXXll be when weXXXreXready to give an exhibition. ThatXXXll be before very long, though.XXXXXXXXSo?XXXXXXXXYes; Step and I have figured out just what to do. When weXXXre ready forXpractice flights, weXXXll take the Saracen out to the lake, where thereXXXsXelbow-room in the big field, and where we wonXXXt be bothered by crowds.XThereXXXs an old shed in which we can keep the machine at night, andXweXXXll take care to lug it out to the lake without attracting attention.XThis is a private affair till we get ready for public exhibitions, youXknow.XXXXXXXXBut lots of people must have been getting some sort of an idea aboutXit--an idea, anyway, that youXXXre up to something.XXXXXXXXWell, the motor does make a racket when we give it a test whirl. ThenXsome fellows have come rubbering around--thatXXXs true. But Step and IXhavenXXXt peeped. Why, the other day, Jack Hagle----XXX There Poke paused,Xa line of perplexity showing, of a sudden, in his forehead. XXXI say,XSam! there was something funny about HagleXXXs actions. You know what aXqueer way he has sometimes--almost hang-dog, itXXXs so cringing? Well, heXwas fair ready to fawn all over us, but the funny part was, he wantedXto talk about the Trojan. It was as if he made our scheme an excuse forXasking about our gang, first in general and then in particular aboutXthe Trojan. And he said he was sorry for him--he said it twice. HeXdidnXXXt explain, though.XXXXXXXXDid you ask him to?XXXXXXXXN-no. You see, we wanted to get rid of him, so we didnXXXt make any moreXtalk than we had to. After heXXXd gone we happened to think of the queerXside of his performance.XXXXXXXXUmph!XXX said Sam, non-committally. He regretted that Poke had notXencouraged Hagle to talk, but understood that at present the SaracenXrepresented almost everything the builder deemed worth a thought. JackXHagle, shuffling, vacillating, a weakling, counted for little in theXopinion of the boys of the town; it was not cause for wonder that PokeXhad been glad to be rid of him. But Sam was beginning to suspect thatXin some way or other, at present beyond his knowledge, Hagle mightXbe able to throw light on the mystery which lay at the bottom of theXtroubles of the club.XXAbout this time, too, Herman Boyd made a discovery, which causedXSam some uneasiness. There had been a sale of land near the lake,Xthe purchase being made by a syndicate in which ZornXXXs father wasXinterested.XXXXXI couldnXXXt find out just the boundaries,XXX Herman reported, XXXbut I wasXtold that the tract is across the lake from the pavilion. ThatXXXd put itXsomewhere in our district.XXXXXSam nodded. XXXIt might, certainly.... If it does, I reckon we may haveXto move--if Ed Zorn can stir up his father to evict us.XXXXXXXXWell, the Zorns have taken one of the new cottages. I hear quite aXnumber of families are going to be in the lake colony this summer.XXXXXXXXUmph! If they donXXXt bother us, weXXXll agree not to bother them,XXX SamXremarked. XXXWe are managing to flock by ourselves pretty successfully.XXXXXXXXOh, thatXXXs our game, all right,XXX declared Herman.XXXXXAnd weXXXll play it through,XXX Sam insisted.XXXXXSure! Only--only,XXX--Herman hesitated--XXXonly itXXXs curious, Sam, howXlong this row with the rest of the class keeps up.XXXXXXXXWell, we didnXXXt start it, but we can stand it as long as the otherXfellows can. They can let us alone, and we can let them alone--andXthatXXXs all there is to it.XXXXXBut XXXletting aloneXXX is not always an easy course, in affairs eitherXgreat or small. So Sam was convinced when he heard of the battleXbetween Tom Orkney and Scrub Payne, who, it will be recalled, hadXblacked PokeXXXs eye in the early stages of the feud. Orkney had vowedXto avenge his friend, and had not forgotten his pledge. Accordingly,Xwhen he came upon Poke and Payne in the middle of an excited group, andXheard loud sounds of dispute, he shouldered a way through the press andXwas just in time to see Scrub cuff the smaller boy.XXOrkney caught ScrubXXXs arm and half turned him in his tracks.XXXXXTake somebody of your size!XXX he challenged. XXXCut out this hazing theXkids!XXXXXAt that Poke flamed in wrath against his ally. XXXKid yourself, Orkney!XXXXhe roared. XXXSay, you keep out of this! I can do my own fighting.XXXXXXXXAll right, fight me--afterward,XXX said Orkney coolly. XXXDonXXXt bother meXnow, though. IXXXve had a date with this fellow for a good while, and IXXXmXgoing to keep it.XXXXXPayne did not shun combat. Indeed, he hastened it; for he struck OrkneyXsharply in the chest. Tom, who had been vigilantly watching for justXsuch an overture, countered heavily on ScrubXXXs forehead. The crowd fellXback at once, leaving space for the opponents; and in another instantXthe fight was in full progress.XXIn weight there was little advantage on either side, though Payne hadXgreater height and longer reach. Neither was a highly skilled boxer.XThe one great point in OrkneyXXXs favor was a certain grim determinationXwhich counted amazingly in helping him endure punishment, of which, itXmust be confessed, he took a deal, largely because he was so bent onXinflicting it. It was, in short, a XXXhammer and tongsXXX affair, as PokeXsubsequently described it to Sam, with Orkney playing for the otherXXXsXhead and bent on repaying PokeXXXs blackened eye in kind; with no rounds,Xwith scant thought of the rules. Long the issue hung in the balance. SoXwell matched were the two, in fact, that many of the onlookers supposedXPayne was at least holding his own, when, suddenly, he threw an armXover his sorely battered face, whipped about, and took to his heels,Xleaving Tom an undisputed victor, but one who manifestly had had to payXfor his victory.XXPoke escorted Orkney home; then hastened to Sam, to whom he told hisXtale of battle.XXXXXSay, but it was a ripping old fight!XXX was his conclusion. XXXAnd weXwere on top! Sam, itXXXs the turn in the luck for the Safety First Club!XXXXXXXXI hope it is,XXX Sam answered gravely. At the moment he was sharplyXreminded by OrkneyXXXs achievement of his own yet to be settled accountXwith Zorn.XXXXXCHAPTER XIV AGAIN AT THE COUNCIL ROCKXXXOrkneyXXXs battle with Scrub Payne made a great stir in the school. ThereXwere some evidences of a change in the popular temper, which might beXtaken to bear out PokeXXXs view that the luck had turned. Sam and hisXchums noted more signs of good will; they had reason to believe thatXsome of the boys who had voted with them at the election of a classXsecretary were now ready to ally themselves openly with the club. OnXthe other hand, though, there was nothing to indicate that Zorn wasXlosing his hold upon the majority of the class, between whom and theXclub the line continued to be sharply drawn.XXThe club still flocked by itself. No outsider had been invited to visitXthe camp on the lake shore, and no visitor appeared there. On the otherXside of the sheet of water activities were increasing. Although theXbuildings had not been completed, the big pavilion was in conditionXfor use, and a band played there Saturday afternoons and evenings. SomeXof the cottages were occupied, and there was much travel on the roadXleading from town to the new resort. On several occasions Sam saw ZornXspeeding along on his motorcycle, going at a great pace and raising aXthick cloud of dust; and he had glimpses, too, of Jack Hagle driving byXin a light wagon. But they were only glimpses. The fine, dry weatherXheld, and the dust was so deep along the highway that the boys, whenXthey hiked back and forth, often preferred to take to the fields,Xavoiding the smother of the dust clouds.XXBy night, and with all precautions for secrecy, Poke and StepXtransferred the dismantled Saracen to the shed by the big field,Xand then set themselves to reassembling the monster, helped on by aXholiday. They declined assistance from their chums.XXXXXYou chaps mean well,XXX Poke told them, XXXbut the machine has a lot ofXdelicate adjustments, and--well, I donXXXt want to hurt your feelings,Xbut your fingers would be all thumbs. So you just leave things to StepXand me, and weXXXll show you.XXXXXXXXWhen?XXX somebody asked pointedly.XXXXXPretty quick,XXX Poke replied. XXXOf course, all the--er--er--all theXrigging wonXXXt be in place, but in a jiffy weXXXll have things so farXalong that we can give you a pretty good demonstration.XXXXXSam was moved to urge caution. XXXDonXXXt be in too much of a hurry. We canXwait.XXXXXXXXDonXXXt you worry!XXX Poke retorted with a touch of dignity. XXXWeXXXre goingXabout this whole thing right. WeXXXre going to look mathematically beforeXwe leap--understand?XXXXXSam interpreted this as meaning that the Shark had not yet completedXhis computations; and the Shark, on inquiry, admitted that this was theXcase.XXXXXIXXXm not going to make any mistakes, if I can help it,XXX he declared.XXXXToo serious business.XXXXXXXXIt surely is,XXX Sam agreed. XXXBroken bones are no joke.XXXXXXXXHuh! ItXXXs worse to find youXXXre wrong in your calculations!XXXXXSam surveyed the mathematician sternly. XXXConfound it, Shark! CanXXXt youXbe human?XXXXXXXXIXXXm mighty human,XXX vowed the other. XXXI hate to have to confess IXXXveXblundered.XXXXXXXXBut everybody blunders sometimes.XXXXXXXXOught not to--not when itXXXs a case of mathematics.XXXXXSam thought this over. XXXWell, I hope thereXXXll be no slip in yourXfigures this time,XXX he said soberly.XXXXXHuh! There wonXXXt be,XXX quoth the Shark calmly. XXXIXXXll know just whereXIXXXm at before I say a word.XXX And with that he resumed his attentionXto the sheets of mysterious diagrams and computations, which he hadXbrought with him to the camp.XXIt was a week-end stay the club was making at the lake. All the membersXwere there, but when the Shark returned to his labors in the tent,XSam for the moment found himself alone. Herman was fishing somewhereXalong the shore, Poke and Step were fully occupied with the flyingXmachine, Tom Orkney had led the somewhat reluctant Trojan aside, andXwas coaching him on a Latin lesson. Sam strolled over to the bigXCouncil Rock and perched himself on one of its ledges. There he wasXhalf-meditating, half-dozing, when Herman came into sight, hurryingXalong at a great pace. Instantly he hailed Sam:XXXXXSay, IXXXve found something--got a tip of trouble! Call the crowdXtogether, and IXXXll tell you.XXXXXSam shouted lustily. Step and Poke were out of hearing, and the SharkXkept at his task, but Orkney and the Trojan came readily enough. TheyXranged themselves beside Sam, and awaited HermanXXXs tidings.XXXXXWell, it was this way,XXX he explained. XXXI was fooling along, notXcatching anything and not caring much whether I got a nibble or not.XAnd, all of a sudden, that young Hagle came out of the bushes, andXtiptoed up, as if he were afraid of his life. I donXXXt like him. So IXwas pulling in my line and getting ready to quit, when he began toXstammer out something about my waiting to hear some important news.XI asked him what it was, and he stammered worse than ever, and keptXturning and peering around, as if he thought a bear was about to jumpXout at us. It wasnXXXt easy to make head or tail of what he said; butXfinally I caught his drift. It was about the ownership of the landXweXXXre on. Well, it seems itXXXs part of the tract ZornXXXs father bought,Xand EdXXXs stirring up his father to have us fired as trespassers.XXXXXTom Orkney whistled; SamXXXs expression grew anxious.XXXXXI wonder if his father will do it,XXX said the Trojan.XXXXXI asked about that,XXX Herman went on. XXXHagle thought he might put usXoff. It wouldnXXXt be so much because we were we--because it was ourXcrowd, you know--as because the syndicate wouldnXXXt want to have anybodyXon the land. And thereXXXs always the chance of campers starting a fire,Xespecially when things are as dry as they are now.XXXXXThe boys nodded agreement. XXXFire surely would run through the brushXlike a racer,XXX quoth Orkney.XXXXXWell,XXX said Herman, XXXit was kind of surprising to have Hagle trying toXdo us a good turn. I guess I blurted out something of the sort. Anyway,XJack got more flustered than ever and more nervous, and between theXway he mumbled and his wriggles when he turned to see if anybody wasXspying on us I didnXXXt catch half he said. But what I did catch seemedXto be about being sorry for something or somebody. And then he brokeXoff short, and beat it. Say! he slipped away like a snake almost! FunnyXchap, that Hagle, I tell you!XXXXXXXXSeems to mean well, though,XXX Orkney observed.XXHerman was glancing at Sam as leader of the clan. XXXWhatXXXs your notionXabout the business?XXX he asked.XXXXXThat for some reason or other Hagle is trying to do us a favor. IXdonXXXt know why--I donXXXt see how we can discover the reason. But weXXXdXbetter take advantage of his tip.XXXXXXXXHow?XXX Orkney inquired.XXXXXBy going straight to Mr. Zorn and asking permission to stay where weXare.XXXXXXXXThatXXXd be taking the bull by the horns.XXXXXXXXItXXXs the best way. If weXXXve got to leave, letXXXs go gracefully and notXbe kicked out.XXXXXXXXThatXXXs sense!XXX the Trojan declared.XXXXXRight!XXX said Orkney. XXXBut when will you look Mr. Zorn up?XXXXXXXXNow--right away,XXX Sam answered. XXXVery likely heXXXs at his cottage thisXafternoon.XXXXXXXXWant any company?XXXXXSam deliberated a moment. XXXYes. Maybe it would be a good scheme toXhave the crowd along, so he could look us over and see that weXXXre notXdangerous.XXXXXXXXThen youXXXll take Poke and Step and the Shark?XXXXXXXXWeXXXll give them a chance to go, anyway.XXXXXBut the Shark, as it proved, preferred to remain in the camp. HeXgrowled savagely when Sam looked into the tent.XXXXXHang it all, donXXXt interrupt me! Keep away, canXXXt you? IXXXm justXgetting where IXXXve tried to arrive for a week. IXXXll be there in fiveXminutes more, if only youXXXll let me alone.XXXXXXXXAll right; suit yourself,XXX said Sam, and stepped back. He beckoned toXOrkney, the Trojan and Herman, and led the way through the woods to theXshed in the big field.XXThere, evidently, something was doing. The Saracen was standing inXplain sight before the shed, poised trimly on the bicycle wheels andXwith wings symmetrically out-spread. Step was pottering about theXmotor, while Poke, hands on hips, was surveying the machine withXimmense satisfaction.XXXXXHulloo! What! Finished, is it?XXX Sam inquired with interest.XXXXXOh, practically,XXX replied Poke loftily. XXXFew odds and ends to beXadjusted, maybe--thatXXXs all.XXXXXXXXDo you mean youXXXre ready to fly?XXXXXXXXWhy not?XXXXXSam coughed dubiously.XXStep, finishing his work on the motor, joined the others. XXXSome bird ofXa job there, eh?XXX he remarked complacently.XXXXXUmph! Proof of the bird is the flying,XXX said Orkney drily.XXPoke and Step exchanged glances. XXXOh, sheXXXll fly fast enough,XXX theXformer declared. XXXStart the motor, then get her to moving, then shiftXthe planes, and--whisk, there you are!XXXXXXXXWhere are you?XXXXXXXXUp over head, and going like sixty!XXXXXXXXShucks! I donXXXt believe it.XXXXXAgain the builders glanced at each other. XXXMight start her up, and letXXXXem see how she pulls,XXX Step suggested.XXSam now noticed that a rope ran from the rear of the machine to aXstump, to which it was made fast.XXXXXOh, youXXXre anchored, are you?XXX said he.XXXXXThatXXXs so we can make a test, and judge the power weXXXre getting fromXthe propeller.XXXXXXXXHurrah! LetXXXs see the wheels go round,XXX cried Herman.XXXXXWhy--why, I guess we can show you,XXX said Poke.XXXXXSure we can!XXX declared Step enthusiastically; and, marching backXto the machine, cranked the motor. There was a tremendous sputter,Xfollowed by a deafening barking. Step stretched his long arms andXtugged at a lever, whereat the propeller began to revolve smoothly andXswiftly.XXStep shut off the power, and as the noise of the motor ceased peered atXhis friends. One or two had their hands at their ears, but all appearedXto be impressed by the performance.XXXXXWell, what are you going to say now?XXX he demanded.XXXXXSo far, so good,XXX said Sam. XXXOnly----XXXXXXXXWhatXXXs the use of XXXonlyXXX and XXXifXXX and XXXbutXXX and all such discouragingXtalk? YouXXXll never get anywhere by it.XXXXXXXXThe SaracenXXXs in grand voice--IXXXll say so much for him,XXX HermanXvolunteered.XXXXXHo, ho! That isnXXXt a marker to his performance when he really getsXgoing and warms up.XXXXXTom Orkney had been regarding the machine intently. XXXLook here, Step!XXXXhe said. XXXYouXXXve no self-starter. WhatXXXll you do if the motor stopsXwhen youXXXre doing loops half a mile up?XXXXXIt was Poke who made answer. XXXHuh! What good would a self-starter do?XXXXXXXXWell, IXXXd hate to have to get out of the seat and try to walk aroundXon air and crank up,XXX Orkney pointed out.XXPoke reddened. XXXMuch you fellows know about flying! Of course you canXXXtXwalk around on air, and rest wrenches on clouds, or crawl under theXmachine to see whatXXXs wrong! You donXXXt do things that way.XXXXXXXXWell, what _do_ you do?XXXXXXXXGive us a dress rehearsal,XXX suggested the Trojan.XXXXXI will!XXX cried Poke excitedly, and climbed to the seat of theXSaracenXXXs driver. There he settled himself, swiftly tested a brace ofXlevers, twanged the wire braces experimentally, and nodded to Step.XXXXXWind her up!XXX he ordered. XXXWeXXXll show XXXem a thing or two.XXXXXStep seized the crank, willingly enough.XXXXXSay, donXXXt forget, Poke, to advance the spark,XXX jeered Herman.XXXXXHuh! ItXXXs kept that way!XXX snapped Poke.XXStep spun the crank, and the furious barking of the motor began again.XIndeed, it was louder than before and the reports came with muchXgreater frequency. The propeller revolved with a speed which made theXblades melt into a sort of hazy halo. The anchor rope tautened. SoXgreat was the strain that, to SamXXXs anxious eye, the line seemed toXshrink.XXXXXHold on! ThatXXXs enough!XXX he shouted, but the thunder of theXmufflerless motor drowned his voice. He turned to his companions--andXcaught sight of the Shark, approaching at a run and wildly waving aXsheet of paper above his head.XXThen Poke did something--none of the onlookers knew just what; evenXStep later had to confess ignorance. But the something was followed byXan increase in the furious roaring of the motor. The whirling bladesXof the propeller spun madly. The anchor line vibrated like a fiddleXstring. Then, suddenly, it parted with a report audible even in thatXfrightful tumult.XXThe Saracen shot forward, gliding with swiftly increasing speed onXits bicycle wheels. There was a slight slope to accelerate its start,Xthough, truth to tell, there seemed to be no need of such help. TheXboys saw Poke making strange motions, tugging vainly at the levers, asXhe dashed away on such a ride as had never entered into even the dreamsXof any of them.XXThe Shark came up, breathless with haste. He caught SamXXXs arm, andXstared dazedly at the departing machine.XXXXXStop him, somebody!XXX he gasped. XXXJust--just worked it out. WhatXXXd youXlet Poke go for before I told him? That--that thing wonXXXt fly!XXXXXXXXCHAPTER XV THE DASH OF THE SCARY HENXXXNothing had been further from PokeXXXs intention than such a wild ride asXthat in which he now found himself engaged.XXAll he had proposed was a sort of XXXdock trialXXX--to use an expressionXhe had once employed in talking with Sam; but now, to his bewildermentXand alarm, he was going to sea, so to speak. Great pains had beenXtaken in the adjustment of the bicycle wheels under the plane, andXMaster Mechanic Step had been proud of their smooth running on theirXball-bearings. Indeed, so well had friction been reduced that theXSaracen could be wheeled about easily; but now it was all too evidentXthat the wheeling by engine power was also easily accomplished. TheXpush of the swiftly-whirling propeller and the slope was producing aXmost effective combination. The Saracen shot away from the anchorage asXan arrow shoots from a bow, and then bettered the performance of anyXarrow by traveling faster and faster as it advanced.XXPoke did his best to stop the machine--and failed signally. Perhaps inXthe haste of his surprise he lost his head for a moment, and managedXto do the wrong thing; perhaps--and this is quite as probable--theXfault lay in the mechanism. The devices for controlling the engine andXthe wings were still in the experimental stage; and, as it happened,Xwere really more the products of StepXXXs ingenuity than of PokeXXXs.XUnchallenged credit for the basic idea of a flying machine belongedXto the latter, but practical working out of the plans had fallen moreXand more to his partner in the enterprise; and StepXXXs way of doingXthings was not likely to be anybody elseXXXs way. Moreover, StepXXXsXextraordinarily long arms and legs gave him a reach for which pudgyXPoke could not hope; and all the levers and controls were adjustedXto StepXXXs liking. Sitting in the saddle, Poke was unable to touchXcertain cords of high importance in the general scheme of navigationXof the craft; his feet swung clear of pedals, also essential to itsXmanagement. As for the levers upon which he laid hold--well, theyXwouldnXXXt work, at least, as he wished them to work. The net result ofXhis early endeavors seemed to be merely a further quickening of theXalready terrifying speed of motor and propeller and of the pace of theXSaracen.XXThe aircraft dashed down the gentle slope almost as a toboggan mightXslip down its chute; though its motion had a curiously buoyant qualityXno toboggan could claim. It was riding such as Poke had never beforeXknown. The broad planes seemed to lift it smoothly and lightly over theXirregularities in the turf of the field. It swayed, to be sure, butXthere was something easy and graceful in the lateral motion; somethingXalmost birdlike, something which roused PokeXXXs hope and ambition, onceXhis first panic passed and he discovered that he was not only stillXalive but also unharmed. He hadnXXXt intended to try to fly that day, butXthe feeling of XXXliftXXX was undeniably luring. He thought of the doubtingXThomases who were watching his performance. He reached decision. HeXXXdXshow XXXem, and show XXXem then and there!XXHe bent forward. Again he seized the levers, by which he expected toXshift his planes for the rise clear of earth. He tugged valiantly.XNothing happened. He threw all his strength into another effort--andXsomething did happen! Nothing but the back of the seat saved him fromXtumbling bodily from the machine, as one of the bars of wood brokeXshort off under the strain.XXPoke recovered his balance by a mighty effort. Also he strove to keepXhis wits about him. Plainly, he could not fly. Seemingly, he could notXstop the motor. It was behind him, and placed low down in a peculiarlyXinaccessible spot. Even the long-limbed Step, in cranking it, had beenXforced almost to crawl under the machine, while as for reaching it fromXthe seat--that was wholly out of the question. The so-called safetyXdevices of StepXXXs contrivance were out of commission. Poke, summarizingXhis situation, set his jaw stubbornly. If he couldnXXXt fly and couldnXXXtXstop, he might at least be able to steer the Saracen and circle the bigXfield to the edification of all beholders; and trust to luck to haltXthe motor sooner or later.XX[Illustration: POKE CLUNG TO HIS SEAT]XXNow, the SaracenXXXs rudder might have been mightily effective inXmid-air--this was a matter fated to be left in uncertainty--but it wasXpoorly calculated to guide a runaway machine on the ground. It was aXsmall trailing plane, set vertically. PokeXXXs attempts to adjust it wereXin vain, at least so far as securing the desired effect. The SaracenXmerely lurched to one side; then swung back, dipping its wing deeply;Xregained an even keel, but began to zigzag in most distressing fashion.XPoke again was almost thrown from his seat, and was glad to cling forXsupport to the uprights of the framework. The truth burst upon him thatXhe was purely a passenger on this amazing voyage of his.XXEvery voyage has to end. Poke began to wonder most apprehensivelyXhow this would end. He had read accounts of tremendous speed made byXice-sleds equipped with propellers working in air; but, of course, theXbig field was not an icy expanse. The pace he was making suggestedXice-records--at least, to his fancy--but so far it had been due in partXto the slope. Just before him was an almost level stretch. Then cameXa slight rise, to a low stone wall bordering the road. It occurred toXhim that it would be very evil fortune to strike that wall.XXIt must be understood that things had been happening very rapidly forXPoke, and very little time had elapsed since he shot away from hisXfriends. It was a mere matter of seconds till he was crossing theXlevel, and beginning to mount the low ridge. There was a diminution ofXspeed, but it was not a marked diminution; and he saw with terror thatXthe SaracenXXXs momentum would not be checked before the wall was reached.XXThen, in hot haste, he did anything and everything he could in aXdesperate, last chance effort. But the engine roared as violently andXrapidly as ever; indeed, he seemed to have contrived to rouse theXancient mechanism to a frenzy of energy. The planes dipped and roseXwith the swaying of the monster. There was a queer, sidewise lunge;Xthen, swiftly, a bewildering change. A thrill ran through Poke. Of aXsudden, the motion of the craft had become smooth, buoyant, marvelouslyXexhilarating. The vibration of the motor remained, but there was noXlonger the jar of wheels on uneven ground. He could still see theXthreatening wall, but it was no longer before him, barring the way.XIt was beneath him. He was vaulting it with a dozen feet to spare. TheXSaracen was flying!XXThat second was like no other Poke had known.XXWonderful elation filled him. Forgotten in the glorious instant wereXhis past labors and the uncertainties of his immediate future. WhereXwere the doubters and scoffers now? What wouldnXXXt the most cynical andXpessimistic among them give to be able to share that triumph of flightXachieved! His faith was justified; StepXXXs ingenuity was confirmed byXpractical performance. The Saracen was in flight!XXNo dream of PokeXXXs had ever been more delightful--and no dream couldXend more speedily than this fleeting jubilation.XXThe Saracen had risen; now the Saracen fell. In truth, the machineXXXsXperformance suggested a tremendous bound rather than soaring; andXPoke hardly had grasped the amazing fact that he was going up beforeXthe equally important circumstance was impressed upon him that heXwas coming down. There was nothing for him to do. He was merelyXa passenger. He was aware of a sharp swerve of course to theXleft. Instead of a high barrier of trees before him, there was anXopening--and the opening was the highway. By sheer good fortune theXchange of direction in mid-air had saved him from crashing into theXfurther bank, and had brought him into the road leading toward theXlake. He felt the jar as the wheels again touched the ground, and cameXto understanding of what was happening, even if he had no clear notionXof how it had been brought about. As by a miracle he was in the road,Xand traveling at a great pace, the gentle slope of the country lakewardXdoing its part in promoting his sensational progress.XXAnd what a startling performance it was! Picture a quiet country road,Xof a sudden invaded by a fiercely panting monster, a sort of wingedXdragon, rushing along in a tumult of uproar and stirring dense cloudsXof dust in its passage; the tips of its wings brushing the trees onXeither hand. Poke, deafened by the whir of the propeller and the savageXdetonations of the motor, clung to his seat and closed his eyes thatXhe might not behold the perils lurking in his path. What would happenXif he met a heavily loaded wagon, or overtook one of the big trucksXcarrying lumber to the new settlement? Or suppose some rash motoristXwas speeding toward him! Suppose----XXBut there was no need to worry himself with conjectures. The real thingXimpended. Something made him open his eyes. A big touring car wasXturning a bend in the road just ahead of him. In a flash he recognizedXthe man at the wheel--Lon Gates. In another, he was aware that by someXmarvel of dextrous steering Lon had shot his car into the ditch, thatXthe SaracenXXXs wing was grazing his head, that by a miracle a collisionXhad been avoided. Poke couldnXXXt have seen it, but, somehow, he knewXthat Lon, wide-eyed with amazement, was staring after the swirl of dustXin which the strange chariot was roaring along.XXWhat Lon said Poke couldnXXXt know. But the words were these:XXXXXJee-whillikens and Jupiter crickets! Talk about a Scary Hen! A millionXold biddies cacklinXXX and runninXXX from a hen hawk wouldnXXXt be a markerXto that there crazy road rioter! But whatXXXs Poke thinkinXXX heXXXs tryinXXXXto do? And whereXXXs he supposed to be headinXXX for? Way heXXXs takinXXX upXthe whole road and then a leetle more heXXXs bound to have trouble and aXheap of it mighty quick and enthusiastic! Guess IXXXd better be follerinXXXXalong, soXXXs to be able to help pick up the pieces.XXXXXAnd with that Lon threw on his power, turned the big car about, andXhurried in the hazy wake of the Saracen.XXPoke, meanwhile, was continuing his wild ride, keeping the road byXsome freak of fortune. The slight but steady fall in the grade wasXmaking amends for any eccentricities of conduct on the part of theXancient motor, which, it must be confessed, was beginning to betrayXsome of its weaknesses. It was missing fire now and then; but,Xcuriously, the breaks seemed to make the uproar all the greater andXmore ear-splitting. It sufficed, at any rate, to give warning of hisXapproach to a woman, who had been driving tranquilly toward town. Poke,Xsweeping along, had a glimpse of a frightened horse plunging throughXa wayside thicket, of a white-faced driver plying a whip frantically,Xof a buggy careening dizzily. Then his second escape from collisionXhad been made and he was dashing through woods, and praying that theXsidewise plunge he believed to be inevitable would not come until heXwas again in open country.XXThe snorting of his motor was more irregular--and a bit moreXterrifying. The whir of the propeller appeared to grow shriller. TheXXXXliftXXX of the machine was less noticeable. One wing, indeed, hadXsuffered much damage at its tip by contact with branches, and on theXother side there was an observable sag of the planes. Something hadXgone wrong astern--just what the trouble was he could not discover. NotXthat it mattered, though. By this time he was ready enough to let theXSaracen go to the scrap-heap, if only he could escape with his life.XXHe was coming, now, to the border of the wooded tract. Through theXtrees to the left he had brief sight of the gleaming blue water of anXarm of the lake. At that his courage rose a bit. He could swim. If theXmachine ended its runaway career in the depths, he would fare wellXenough, if he could avoid going down with the ship. It behooved him toXmake sure that he would not be caught by parts of the machine if heXtried to jump. He bent forward, he strove for firmer footing on theXcross braces. And then----XXThe ending of the SaracenXXXs dash was as sudden as its beginning. AXlurch to the right was not followed by recovery. Instead, the machineXheld its new course, left the beaten track of the road, plunged intoXa tangle of undergrowth, which served as an efficient, if painful,Xbrake. Thorns raked PokeXXXs arms and tore his clothes, just as branchesXripped the planes to ribbons and saplings, bending before the machineXXXsXcharge, yet contrived to check it. The broken roar of the motor ceased;Xthe whir of the propeller died away. In a second or two the monster ofXthe road was stripped of all terrors, and lay in the midst of a tangledXheap of debris, half contributed by its own parts and half by the brushXand vines it had uprooted.XXPoke had pitched forward from his saddle. Indeed, it was as if a giantXarm had picked him up and tossed him bodily through another clump ofXdense undergrowth--and thereby supplied him with a sort of naturalXshock absorber. There was a tremendous cracking and crashing of smallXbranches and twigs; and from the farther side of the thicket PokeXrolled out upon the ground, shaken from head to foot, bleeding from aXscore of scratches, his garments fit only for the rag-bag. Yet almostXmiraculously he had escaped serious harm. Not a bone was broken. HeXmight be sore and aching from forehead to toe, but all his wounds wereXsuperficial. He could raise himself on hands and knees, and this heXdid. Instead, though, of attempting to get upon his feet, he remainedXas he was for a moment, staring in amazement at the sight which met hisXeyes.XXPoke, as it happened, had been catapulted into a tableau, so to speak,Xin which Zorn and Hagle figured. Apparently, the noisy approach of theXSaracen had interrupted Zorn in the process of disciplining the smallerXboy; for he still held Hagle by the collar, while with his victim heXgazed spellbound at the picture presented by Poke in the rXXle of theXhuman projectile.XXXXXCHAPTER XVI ZORN SHOWS HIS TEETH AGAINXXXIt occurred to Poke, subsequently, that his appearance on the sceneXproduced upon Zorn and Hagle an effect even more marked than might beXaccounted for by the extraordinary manner of his approach. The pairXwere not merely startled; there was an alarm, a consternation hintingXat something more than surprise or fear of physical harm. It was odd,Xtoo, that they seemed to have difficulty in finding tongue; and it wasXPoke who spoke first.XXXXXHul--hulloo, there!XXX he said, faintly.XXNeither answered. Zorn gave a start, and Hagle cowered like a whippedXdog; but the lips of neither moved.XXWith some difficulty Poke got upon his feet.XXXXXHul--hulloo!XXX he repeated. XXXSay, but you fellows must be thinking aXlot to say so little!XXXXXAt that Zorn, with a warning glance at Hagle, loosed his grip on theXlatterXXXs collar.XXXXXEh? Say so little? ThereXXXs a lot to say and ask.XXX Zorn, having foundXhis tongue, could employ it briskly. XXXGreat Scott! but what have youXbeen up to? You come smashing into us, almost, and then want to knowXwhy we donXXXt make speeches? Look here! What have you been doing? WhatXin the name of all crazy cats is that thing you were riding on?XXXXXPoke turned to glance ruefully at the wreck of the Saracen.XXXXXOh, that? ThatXXXs a--a--er--er--thatXXXs a machine IXXXve been foolingXwith.XXXXXXXXUmph! Looks more as if it had fooled with you.XXX Zorn came forward, andXgazed with undisguised interest at the ruin. XXXUmph! Guess I know whatXthis is--or was. Somebody tipped me off the other day that you wereXmonkeying with a flying machine. But I didnXXXt think you had gumption toXdo anything with it. But you didnXXXt fly here, did you?XXXXXXXXNot exactly,XXX Poke told him with a degree of dignity. XXXI--I--well, IXcame on wheels, as you might say.XXXXXXXXBut--but you arenXXXt hurt, are you?XXX Hagle asked tremulously.XXXXXNo; not to speak of.XXXXXXXXIXXXm glad of that!XXX said Hagle so heartily that Poke glanced at himXwonderingly.XXZorn scowled, and kicked at a broken plane. XXXYouXXXre lucky to save yourXneck!XXX he growled. XXXFunny the things that donXXXt kill idiots! But if youXarenXXXt damaged, this contraption of yours is, all right! Mighty fewXpieces left to put together, I should say!XXXXXPoke was relieved of the need of making reply; for just then Lon GatesXcame upon the scene, having left his automobile in the road. It tookXhim but an instant to grasp the situation.XXXXXWell, I guess youXXXve done it now,XXX he remarked, having satisfiedXhimself that Poke had come to no great harm. XXXWay you was scootinXXXXalong--you and your Scary Hen--say, but you was jest playinXXX tag withXthe high places! And as for monopolizinXXX things--son, I never see suchXa road-hog as you was. You wanted everything between the fences, and byXjiminy, you was takinXXX it! But IXXXd kinder like to know the end oXXX theXstory. What happened in the last chapter?XXXXXXXXI donXXXt know exactly,XXX Poke confessed. XXXIt--it ended mighty suddenly.XXXXXXXXBut it didnXXXt end you--thatXXXs the main pXXXint.XXXXXXXXNo; IXXXm all right,XXX said Poke pluckily. A little stream of blood wasXtrickling from a gash in his cheek. He wiped it away with his sleeve.XHagle stepped up to him, and pulling out his handkerchief, fell toXdabbing at the wound. It was a most kindly meant attention, but PokeXshrank back, in embarrassment. And Lon came to the rescue.XXXXXWell, I guess I may have to find you a barrel to go home in. ThemXpants oXXX yourn is what an artist feller I know would call sorterXimpressionistic. But, seeinXXX as how you ainXXXt killed, I dunnoXXXs thereXXXsXany great cause for complaint. And now, with your kind permission, IXXXllXtake a peek at the remains oXXX the Scary Hen.XXXXXXXXScary Hen!XXX Zorn repeated, and laughed jeeringly. Nobody, however,Xpaid any attention to him. Poke, closely observed by the pitying Hagle,Xinspected his scratched hands and rent garments. Lon made the circuitXof the wrecked flying machine, uttering an exclamation now and then asXhe came upon fresh evidence of the completeness of its ruin. And whileXthese things were doing, Sam and the rest of the club, panting fromXtheir long run in pursuit of the Saracen, came up.XXBroken and hurried queries rained upon Poke, but resulted in slightXincrease in the general stock of knowledge.XXXXXI donXXXt know what was the matter; I guess everything was,XXX heXdeclared. XXXNothing worked right. The controls wouldnXXXt control, and theXrudder wouldnXXXt steer, and the safety things werenXXXt safe. So I----XXXXXXXXHold on there!XXX Step broke in. He strode up to Poke and shook a fingerXin his face. XXXDonXXXt you go to blaming the apparatus! It was you--youXdid it all!XXXXXXXXEh? I--_I_ did it? Why, I----XXXXXXXXYes you did!XXX cried Step, hotly. XXXYou ought to have known that none ofXthe rigging was really ready, and the safety device was disconnected,Xand----XXXXXXXXYou didnXXXt tell me that, and you let me risk my life!XXX shouted Poke inXa rage.XXXXXHowXXXd I know youXXXd gone crazy?XXXXXXXXMe crazy!XXXXXXXXHuh! You look it.XXXXXXXXDo I? Then itXXXs your fault! If you hadnXXXt been making your foolXexperiments and monkeying with things that were all right, I wouldnXXXtXbe in this fix or the Saracen, either. But IXXXll show you!XXXXXXXXDo it--if youXXXre man enough!XXX taunted Step, in a fury at theXaspersions cast on his mechanical skill.XXPoke needed no second invitation. He hurled his ragged and grimy selfXat his partner, who, on his side, met the charge half-way. There wasXa wild exchange of unaimed blows, and then they came to a clinch. SamXsprang forward. So did Orkney. By their united efforts they separatedXthe combatants and dragged them apart.XXXXXStop this scrapping!XXX Sam commanded, with a gruffness which was notXlessened by knowledge that Zorn was grinning widely at the spectacle ofXdiscord in the club.XXXXXQuit it!XXX Orkney ordered, still more curtly.XXXXXThen make him take back what he said,XXX Step protested.XXXXXItXXXs true!XXX shrilled Poke. XXXWay he left everything, XXXtwas like tryingXto drive a horse without reins or bridle!XXXXXXXXThen you ought to have known enough not to try to ride the Saracen,XXXXStep countered.XXXXXYou didnXXXt tell me.XXXXXXXXWhy didnXXXt you have sense enough to ask? If youXXXd had your eyes openXas wide as your mouth----XXXXXTwo things helped to end this abusive debate. One was the action ofXSam and Orkney, each of whom shook his captive, not too gently. TheXother was the appearance of adult investigators of the disaster to theXSaracen. A runabout came to a stop in the road, and two men, leavingXthe car, crossed to the group.XXXXXWhew! This looks like the end of a real joy ride!XXX said the leader ofXthe pair. XXXSmashed, and smashed for fair! But what kind of a----Say,XZorn!XXX he turned to his companion, a stout, middle-aged man. XXXBy theXgreat horn spoon, but hereXXXs whatXXXs left of a make of machine thatXbeats my time!XXXXXMr. Zorn ran his eye over the tangle of planes and machinery.XXXXXFor a guess itXXXs a flyer of some sort. But whereXXXs the aeronaut?XXXXXPoke, released by Sam, stepped forward. XXXI--well, I was running it, orXtrying to run it, sir. And--and--well, things miscued, somehow.XXXXXXXXBut did it fly?XXXXXXXXYes, sir, it did--once. And it moved a whole lot.XXXXXFrom the other side of the wreck Lon contributed his bit: XXXSpeakinXXX oXXXXmovinXXX, this affair made me think of a canal boat--XXXtwas so different.XXXXXMr. Zorn smiled. XXXWell, thereXXXs evidence enough here that it didnXXXtXprecisely crawl through the bushes. But nobodyXXXs killed, I infer.XXXXXXXXNot permanently,XXX chuckled Lon. XXXStill, clothes suffered--yes, clothesXand feelinXXXs. Pretty solid bump at the last, you see.XXXXXXXXSo I imagine,XXX said Mr. Zorn. XXXLucky the motor didnXXXt set theXscrap-heap afire. But it must have been quite a machine to start with.XXXXAnd with that he began an observation tour about the Saracen, very muchXas Lon had made one. His companion appeared to be less interested;Xfor, after fidgeting for a moment, he called out, impatiently:XXXXXLetXXXs be getting along, Zorn! ThereXXXs nothing we can do here, andXweXXXll be late for our appointment, as it is.XXXXXMr. Zorn turned, and walked toward his car; but Sam, reminded of theXerrand he had proposed to do, quickly overtook him.XXXXXCan you give me a minute, sir?XXX he asked. XXXItXXXs about the camp--theXplace where weXXXve pitched a tent, I mean. We hear that it is on yourXland, and weXXXd like to get permission to stay there, or rent a littleXground, or--or do whatever you think right.XXXXXEd Zorn had followed Sam. XXXItXXXs the squatter business I told youXabout,XXX he said to his father, meaningly. XXXA whole crowd has moved in,Xbag and baggage.XXXXXXXXOh!XXX said Mr. Zorn; his tone was not encouraging. XXXSo youXXXre theXcamping party, eh? H-m-m! I donXXXt know about it, young man. The woodsXare mighty dry, and a little carelessness might cost me a pretty penny.XXXXXXXXWeXXXll be careful,XXX Sam urged. XXXWe understand the danger of starting aXbrush fire.XXXXXXXXUmph!XXX said Mr. Zorn doubtfully.XXXXXBut weXXXll promise----XXXXXXXXWhat good are promises?XXX Ed interrupted.XXThere he made a mistake. XXXI think I can attend to my own affairs,XXX hisXfather said testily. XXXSuppose you devote yourself to your own, Ed.XXXXThen he turned to Sam. XXXIXXXm not ready to say yes or no, definitely.XIXXXll have to have a look at your place first. It isnXXXt a matter ofXrental, but is a matter of safety; I want to see how you are doingXthings. IXXXll come over in a day or two.XXXXXXXXThank you, sir,XXX said Sam.XXXXXUmph! Better wait for results,XXX quoth Mr. Zorn drily, and resumed hisXmarch to the runabout, in which his companion was already seated.XXAs the little car shot away, Ed Zorn caught Sam, roughly, by theXshoulder.XXXXXLook here! YouXXXll pay for this!XXX he cried. XXXYou may think you can getXaround my father with your slick palavering, but it wonXXXt work. YourXcase will be attended to, soon enough!XXXXXSam shook himself free. XXXKeep your hands off me, Zorn!XXX he saidXsharply.XXXXXHuh! LetXXXs see you make me keep XXXem off!XXXXXXXXIXXXm ready to try. Get that straight--IXXXm ready to try, right now!XXXXXSamXXXs voice was not raised, but there was a note in it that hinted atXreadiness to meet trouble half-way. Truth to tell, the head of theXSafety First Club was beginning to feel the time was ripe for theXpersonal reckoning he meant to have with this enemy.XXZornXXXs face darkened. He cast a swift glance at the other boys in theXbackground, and shook his head.XXXXXNo; IXXXm no fool,XXX he declared. XXXIXXXd take you on and never bat anXeyelash, but you and your whole gang, all at once? No. IXXXll attend toXyou later on, when you havenXXXt all your heelers along.XXXXXXXXI promise you they wonXXXt interfere.XXXXXZorn snapped his fingers. XXXThat for your promises! I know what IXXXmXgoing to do, and when IXXXm going to do it--and this isnXXXt the timeXor the place. But when IXXXm ready, then you want to look out for me,XParker!XXXXXSam laughed in his face. XXXBosh! YouXXXve been doing us all the harm youXcan.XXXXXOddly enough, Zorn laughed in return, but the laugh had no mirth in it.XXXXThink so, do you? Well, youXXXll have a chance to change that opinion.XI tell you----XXX Then he checked himself, and called to Hagle, who hadXbeen hovering near by. XXXHere, Jack, come along! Say! get a move on,XcanXXXt you?XXXXXHagle obeyed, though with an air of reluctance.XXXXXEr--er--good-bye, you fellows,XXX he quavered, and shuffled after Zorn,Xwho already was striding away.XXXXXCHAPTER XVII SAM HEADS A FISHING PARTYXXXEver since Lon had recited the tale of Old Man FreemanXXXs William TroutXhe had been much importuned by the boys for information about theXstream in which the big fish lived and grew mighty. He had chosen toXmake a great mystery of the matter, but under repeated questioning hadXdropped a hint here and spoken an inadvertent word there, until Sam,Xputting one thing with another, was able not only to form an opinion ofXthe direction in which the brook lay, but also to make a shrewd guessXat the whereabouts of the hermitXXXs cabin, or what might be left of it.XXSam had been planning an expedition of exploration and discovery, andXthe disaster to the Saracen quickened his purpose. Poke took the wreckXvery much to heart. In imagination he had pictured himself sailingXgaily above the heads of admiring crowds; but, to do him justice,Xhe had counted more upon the money returns of his enterprise thanXupon the attendant glory. Poke was a thoroughly honest chap, and itXirked him to be in debt. He had hoped to repay his friends, and nowXthat hope was dissipated, to say nothing of sundry new obligationsXincurred in the construction of the airplane. Naturally, therefore, heXwas temporarily taking a gloomy view of life, and was in sore need ofXsoothing diversions.XXStep, too, was grieved by the calamity, though his disappointment wasXnot so keen. After all, he was not the originator of the Great Idea;Xthat melancholy honor belonged exclusively to Poke. Hence, when he hadXreached a more amicable understanding with his partner in regard to theXcondition of the SaracenXXXs gear, it was easier for him to take the viewXthat there was no virtue in shedding tears over spilt milk. But Step asXwell as Poke would be the better for new interests, Sam decided; andXquest of the Freeman brook suggested a desirable opportunity.XXMr. Zorn had spoken of inspecting the camp in a day or two, but theXweek wore away with no word from him. On Friday afternoon the club, inXfull force, hiked to the lake, prepared to remain there until MondayXmorning, when Lon was to appear with the big car and whisk them backXto town in time for school. The evening passed pleasantly and quietly,Xtheir nightXXXs rest was undisturbed, and early Saturday morning SamXmarshaled the clan for the march across country. All carried fishingXtackle, though it was admitted that angling would be a mere incident ofXthe day.XXXXXI donXXXt know just how far weXXXre going, but IXXXve got a general idea ofXthe direction,XXX Sam told the others, who appeared to be willing enoughXto follow his lead and take chances. So they set out, with Sam at theXhead of the straggling line, laying his course in part by aid of aXpocket compass he carried, and in part by certain landmarks known toXall of them.XXThe route scorned roads, mostly, crossing fields and woods, climbingXlow hills and dipping into little valleys, edging away from the lakeXand carrying the party into a region with which they had slightXacquaintance. They passed a few farmhouses, but most of the time wereXout of sight of habitations; for the country thereabouts was thinlyXsettled. The pace was leisurely. The boys had all day before them, andXthere was plenty of opportunity for Sam to have a confidential word orXtwo, now with one of his friends and then with another.XXOrkney, for example, was beginning to worry about the Trojan, inXcoaching whom he had been especially active of late.XXXXXItXXXs getting harder to keep him up to the mark,XXX he explained. XXXNo; IXdonXXXt call it a case of quitting--itXXXs more of a case of not caring.XYou see, down at bottom the Trojan feels that he wasnXXXt given a squareXdeal, and the thing rankles. He appreciates the trouble the club isXtaking for him, and has tried to do his part; but, somehow, heXXXs noXreal heart for the job. He doesnXXXt care--thereXXXs the rub; and that sortXof thing makes a difference, when youXXXre in for a long pull like thisXone. Oh, I guess heXXXll stick it out in a way--go through the motions,Xanyway, you know--but if weXXXre to hold him with the class, thereXXXs gotXto be something to spur him up, and itXXXs got to come pretty quickly.XXXXXSam nodded, and his expression grew serious. His opinion was much likeXTomXXXs. The Trojan needed a mental bracer of some sort, but how it wasXto be found he could not conjecture. As for himself, he had Lon asXcounselor in seasons of depression, but Lon had not tried to deal withXWalker.XXThen Tom fell back, and presently Poke drew up with the leader.XHe was still in his mood of depression, and Sam had to make talkXwithout marked response for a time. At last, though, Poke showed someXanimation. Curiously, it was mention of Jack Hagle which stirred him.XXXXXItXXXs a funny thing to say,XXX he remarked, XXXand maybe youXXXll think I wasXjarred off my trolley, but when the machine crashed into the bushes andXI came that cropper through them, what impressed me most was the wayXZorn and Hagle acted. Now, so far as the suddenness of it went, I mightXhave dropped a couple of miles from the clouds; but that pair behavedXas if the thing that bothered XXXem was not the question whether I wasXkilled or not, but how much I noticed of the thrashing Zorn was givingXJack. I figure if they were so anxious I shouldnXXXt know about it that,Xsomehow, we were mixed up in whatever caused their row.XXXXXXXXIsnXXXt that rather a far-fetched notion?XXXXXXXXIt might be, if Zorn wasnXXXt in the game. That fellowXXXd do anything!XAnd he has Hagle completely under his thumb.XXXXXXXXItXXXs true,XXX Sam admitted. XXXAnd itXXXs true, too, that Hagle has shown aXsort of friendliness for us once or twice.XXXXXPoke wagged his head sagely. XXXI tell you, Sam! Mark my words, HagleXknows something about that business of the TrojanXXXs, and itXXXs worryingXhim! And Zorn is terrorizing him, to keep him quiet.XXXXXXXXBut----XXX Sam began.XXXXXBut what?XXXXXXXXBut Zorn said he could clear the slate for us, and I donXXXt think heXXXdXdo it by incriminating himself.XXXXXXXXNeither would Hagle, would he?XXXXXXXXIt may not sound reasonable, but he might, I think--that is, heXXXd beXmore likely than Zorn to weaken.XXXXXXXXBut it was Zorn who spread all the stories through the school. And itXwas Zorn who cooked up things at the class meeting.XXXXXXXXI admit that. I also admit I donXXXt understand the situation, so far asXthose fellows are concerned.XXXXXXXXI donXXXt either,XXX said Poke. XXXIXXXm perfectly sure, though, theyXXXreXboth in the scheme, somehow. And it almost startled both of XXXem out ofXa yearXXXs growth to see me shooting at them through the bushes. BeyondXthat itXXXs all guesswork with me.XXXXXXXXSame here,XXX Sam agreed, thoughtfully.XXJust then Herman Boyd overtook the leaders and interrupted their talk.XHerman was beginning to be skeptical about SamXXXs mental mapping of theXbrook; and one or two of the others expressed doubts as the hours woreXaway. Sam, however, maintained unruffled composure. He might be wrong,Xbut even if he were wrong, no harm would be done; and so he held hisXway, declined to halt beside any of the little streams they crossed,Xand at last pointed out a brook of considerable size, flowing through aXvalley which was like a gash in the hills.XXXXXThatXXXs it--or itXXXs my guess, anyway,XXX he said. XXXAnd I think FreemanXXXsXcabin and the pool are a little higher up.XXXXXPoke proposed a halt for luncheon before pursuing their explorations,Xand the idea met with favor. It was well after noon when theirXbaskets had been emptied, and the quest was resumed. Again the partyXstraggled. It was a go-as-you-please stroll for everybody. Sam andXthe Shark, who cared little for fishing, were in the van, the othersXpausing now and then to drop a hook, though with small reward forXtheir trouble. Probably an hour slipped away before Sam came to a poolXgenerally answering LonXXXs description of the home of William Trout, andXsome time passed before his followers began to overtake him. Meanwhile,Xwith the SharkXXXs aid, he had been searching for the site of the cabin;Xand had come upon traces of a building of some sort. Evidently thereXhad been a fire, and after that the woods had come in, so that it wasXby no means easy to estimate the size of the building which once hadXstood there.XXThe Shark was not greatly impressed, nor was he inclined to regard theXproof as positive.XXXXXHuh! Maybe itXXXs the place, and, then again, maybe it isnXXXt. May haveXbeen a farmhouse that was abandoned; may have been somebodyXXXs camp.XXXXXXXXAnd so it may have been Old Man FreemanXXXs,XXX Sam pointed out.XXThe Shark shrugged. XXXHuh! XXXMaybeXXX doesnXXXt get you anywhere. I donXXXtXtake much stock in these calculations with no given quantities. And LonXmay have been fooling you.XXXXXXXXI donXXXt think so,XXX said Sam. XXXLon likes to make a good story, butXweXXXve always found some basis for his yarns.XXXXXXXXSame as there was basis for PokeXXXs Saracen, eh? I could have told him,Xoffhand, that heXXXd get enough push from his propeller to trundle himXdown-hill, but I had to do a lot of precise calculation to find outXthat he couldnXXXt fly far.XXXXXIt was on the tip of SamXXXs tongue to remind the mathematician that hisXexact knowledge was reached a trifle late to save Poke from disaster,Xbut he refrained from controversy. Step and the Trojan came along;Xthen Orkney and Poke. Sam pointed out the ruins; there was animatedXdiscussion. The majority stood with Sam, and opined that pool and cabinXsite had been found. Then arrived Herman, highly excited and displayingXa ten-inch trout he had caught a quarter-mile down-stream. In a jiffyXthe anglers were scattered along the brook, fishing as for dear life.XXGiven half a dozen healthy youngsters making holiday, you have aXcombination which does not make for haste. No more trout were taken,Xbut much time was occupied. The afternoon was half gone, when Sam,Xreminded of the long tramp home, called the clan together.XXAs was to be expected, there was less fun and more work about theXreturn journey. Partly for variety and partly because he believedXhe could save distance, Sam chose a new route, a short cut, as heXsupposed, and one taking advantage of a long stretch of country road.XThe grass growing between the wheel tracks showed that it was not muchXtraveled, but when the boys had followed it for some distance they metXa farmer jogging leisurely homeward. From him they learned that theyXwere still far from the lake--or the XXXpond,XXX as he preferred to call it.XXXXXItXXXs risinXXX three mile,XXX he said. XXXShortest wayXXXll be for you to stickXto the road till you come to a steepish hill off to the left. Climb it,Xand youXXXll be able to see an end of the pond--that is, if the woodsXainXXXt growed up soXXXs to hide it. I hainXXXt been sightseeinXXX for a goodXwhile, and I donXXXt know whether the water shows or not.XXXXXSam thanked him for the directions. The XXXsteepish hill,XXX in fact, wasXone of the landmarks by which he intended to steer, and as the hike wasXresumed, he kept a sharp lookout for the abrupt slopes. Estimates ofXdistance, though, are seldom accurate, and the boys had tramped on forXfully an hour before the hill was reached. From its top the lake wasXnot visible, the woods having grown sufficiently to hide the water, butXSam had no difficulty in placing the depression in which it lay. ButXlake and camp were still far away, three or four miles at the least.XXThere was a little mild grumbling.XXXXXHuh! Guess you must have taken the longest way XXXround, Sam,XXX PokeXsuggested.XXXXXGee, but I feel as if my legs were doing double duty!XXX Poke chimed in.XXXXXThatXXXs because youXXXre built for low gear, Poke,XXX chuckled Herman.XXXXXLow gear yourself!XXX snapped the plump youth. XXXIXXXm built on modernXlines--regular safety bicycle idea. You fellows are like the old-styleXhigh wheels--all show and headers!XXXXXSomething in the distance had caught OrkneyXXXs attention, and he wasXstudying it intently.XXXXXWhatXXXs that yonder--low down; just above the tree tops; sort ofXhanging over them? Think itXXXs a dust cloud?XXXXXThere was a thin haze in the air, more suggestive of autumn than ofXlate spring. It faintly blurred the horizon, but Sam could make out theXthickening, so to speak, to which Tom referred.XXXXXDust?XXX he repeated. XXXI donXXXt know. Might be, of course, but----XXXXXXXXBut it looks to me more like smoke,XXX the Trojan interrupted.XXXXXThatXXXs my idea, too,XXX said Sam sharply.XXHe started at a rapid pace down the hill, and his club-mates hurriedXafter him.XXXXXCHAPTER XVIII THE CLUB TURNS FIRE BRIGADEXXXIt was not a thin haze now, but a blurring gray curtain, halfXconcealing the woods before which it hung. A pungent odor filled theXair, which had, too, a curiously irritating, smarting quality, tryingXand painful to eyes and lungs. The boys, panting from their forcedXmarch--the fast walk at which they had descended the hill had quickenedXto a dog trot and then to a run--pulled up a little uncertainly. TheyXhad reached the border of the wooded tract which extended to the lakeXshore, and in which their camp was situated, and now they knew that theXdreaded danger of a forest fire was facing them. Just where it mightXhave started, or how much headway it might have gained, was still to beXdetermined, however; for, though there was smoke a-plenty, no line ofXleaping flames showed.XXSam ran his eye along the front of the woods. Nowhere was the smokeXrolling forth in volumes. It was like the coming of a fog, not yetXthick but dimming everything. The breeze was light; so light, indeed,Xthat though he made the test of a wetted finger, he could be sure ofXlittle except that the general direction of the air currents was towardXthe spot where he was rather than toward the lake. So far as it went,Xthis was a hopeful condition. It meant that the spread of the fireXwould be away from the shore and the tent.XXHe strained his ears as well as his eyes, hoping to hear the shouts ofXmen fighting the fire, but silence lay upon the woods. Plainly, theXalarm had not spread to the summer settlement. The smoke was lying lowXand drifting away from the lake, and, presumably, had not yet beenXobserved by the men at work about the pavilion.XXSam gave his orders briskly, if a bit breathlessly:XXXXXSpread out--in a line! DonXXXt get too far apart, though. First fellowXthat sees anything, yell and yell loud! Now, start in, fellows!XXXXXThey obeyed, readily enough, in very open order, as he had directed,Xand went crashing through the undergrowth.XXSam himself was near the middle of the line. The end man to the leftXwas Tom Orkney, while Herman Boyd had the corresponding place to theXright. Sam went straight forward, but the flankers edged out as theyXadvanced, so that they steadily increased the amount of ground covered.XXAs every one in the party knew, the tract was of the sort to favor aXquick spread of a fire. There was a great deal of dry stuff, and theXlong period of fine weather had made much of it as inflammable asXtinder. Besides, the undergrowth was so dense and tangled in placesXthat flames would find abundant opportunity to move along, while theXdifficulties of coping with them would be increased. Such were theXconditions that Sam began to wonder that the whole tract was not in aXblaze. The fire must have been going for two or three hours, at least;Xthat it had not made more progress was to be accounted for only by theXlack of wind. In the woods, indeed, there was no perceptible breeze,Xand the air was still and heavy as well as smoke-laden.XXLike his mates, Sam plowed ahead, making as much speed as he could. TheXsmoke grew denser, but not very markedly. He was beginning to believeXthat his own course was not carrying him toward the fire, when a shout,Xraised by Orkney, was repeated along the line.XXTom had made the looked-for discovery. Dipping into a hollow, whichXtwo months before had been a swamp, he had been met first by a heavyXpuff of gray fog, so to speak, and through it had caught the yellowXglint of flames. At his call the other boys hurried to him. No word ofXcommand from Sam or from anybody else was needed to set them at theXwork which was to be done. Breaking branches from trees, they began toXbeat the burning brush in the rough and ready fashion which sometimesXis extremely effective in dealing with a fire of the sort. It was notXlight work, nor was it pleasant. It seemed as if the smoke increasedXeven as the flames were checked; and now and again one or anotherXof the club had to drop back for a moment, coughing and choking andXgasping for air. A fine, dust-like ash, too, was raised in tiny clouds;Xmore disagreeable than the smoke itself and quite as penetrating ofXthroat and lung; while the heat of the fire was sufficient to blisterXhands incautiously venturing too near it. Yet, as woods fires go, thisXdid not seem a hard one to deal with. The lack of breeze was in theXboysXXX favor. They were helped, also, by the XXXlay of the land.XXXXXAs has been said, Orkney had come upon the fire in a swampy hollow.XProtracted as the drought had been, it had not sufficed to remove allXthe moisture by the slow process of evaporation, so that there stillXremained miry patches, which served as natural brakes on the advanceXof the flames. A gale, of course, or even a brisk wind, would haveXdisposed of such handicaps quickly enough, but in a comparative calmXthey made a great difference. To Sam it became evident very quicklyXthat the boys were not only checking the slow drift of the fire, butXalso were beginning to get it under control. He paused for a momentXto watch his companions. Orkney was pounding away lustily. The SharkXwas exerting less effort, but his arms rose and fell with mathematicalXregularity. The others were performing, each in his own way, Step withXtremendous swings of his long arms, Poke with a swift succession ofXqueer little pats, the Trojan and Herman Boyd busily and steadily. MuchXencouraged, Sam raised a cheery cry and fell to wielding his broom-likeXweapon with fresh vigor.XXIt isnXXXt to be supposed, though, that with all the favorableXconditions, the club quickly finished the business in which it was nowXengaged. The spread of the fire might be checked, but it still burnedXstubbornly in the area over which it had extended. There were heaps ofXrubbish, dead twigs and branches and rotting leaves, which smoulderedXsullenly long after the flames had died down; there were patches ofXglowing coals, potential danger spots, should a breeze spring up. TheXboys worked back and forth, invading the burned-over tract, crossingXand recrossing it until they were satisfied that immediate danger wasXover. Then came a sort of patrol for half an hour or more, with searchXfor points threatening a fresh start for the flames. At last, Sam spokeXthe word for which the others had waited.XXXXXOut! Guess we can knock off now.XXXXXXXXGood--and a good job at that!XXX Poke declared.XXXXXWell, IXXXm ready to call it half a day and quit,XXX said Herman. XXXIXXXllXXXXfess up--IXXXm tired.XXXXXXXXYes; itXXXs hard work,XXX Sam observed.XXStep thrust a finger almost into PokeXXXs face, and began to laugh.XXXXXHo, ho! Say, fellows, look at the boy beauty turned boy coal-heaver!XXXXXPoke ran a grimy hand across a grimy cheek. XXXHuh! YouXXXre no SpotlessXTown exhibit yourself,XXX he retorted. XXXYou look as if your home addressXwas XXXCare of any ash-barrel.XXXXXXXXXXXWhatXXXs the odds, so long as weXXXve put out the fire?XXX quoth Tom Orkney.XXXXBut, I say! Anybody thought of the time? SunXXXs down, but not one of usXnoticed it!XXXXXThe boys glanced about them as curiously as if Tom had made someXremarkable discovery. They had paid no attention to watches orXsunshine, and now dusk was coming on. Poke tightened his belt with aXjerk.XXXXXSupper time--and past,XXX he remarked. XXXGee, now that IXXXm reminded ofXeating, I could get away with about three square meals at once.XXXXXBy common consent the club started in the direction in which the campXlay. They skirted the burned patch, but at the farther border SamXhalted. The others pulled up too.XXXXXWhatXXXs on your mind, Sam?XXX asked Step.XXSam wrinkled his brow. XXXThere are a few things I donXXXt quite figureXout. I suppose the fire started on this side; for this is the windwardXside, if you can say there was breeze enough to make a windward and aXleeward. Now, what was there here to set it going?XXXXXXXXI donXXXt see anything,XXX said Step, after a pause devoted to observation.XXXXXNor I,XXX chimed in two or three others.XXXXXProbably somebody, going through, was smoking, and got careless with aXmatch or cigarette stub,XXX suggested Tom.XXXXXMaybe,XXX said Sam, shortly.XXXXXWell, what likelier explanation have you?XXXXXSam contented himself with shaking his head and saying, XXXItXXXs queer,Xall the same.XXXXXThe fire, in spite of its leisurely progress, had extended over perhapsXtwo acres, nearly all of which would class as swamp land, though inXmany places it was now as dry as any hill. Still, even where the mireXhad hardened there were hummocks which made walking difficult, to sayXnothing of the thick undergrowth on which the flames had fed. Anybody,Xstrolling through the woods, would be more likely to make a detourXabout the hollow than to tramp across it.XXXXXOh, in a case like this you canXXXt find out half the time what causedXthe trouble,XXX growled Poke. XXXCome on! LetXXXs get to the feed.XXXXXXXXHope it isnXXXt far to camp,XXX said the Trojan.XXXXXHuh! No need to hope!XXX snapped the Shark.XXXXXMeaning weXXXve lost our way?XXXXXXXXMeaning campXXXs just ahead of us. Where are your eyes, anyway?XXXXXXXXCheer up, Shark! DonXXXt be a grouch,XXX counseled Poke.XXThe Shark gave a characteristic shrug. XXXIt ought to grouch anybody toXsee how you fellows donXXXt figure out things. Not that you ever will,Xthough! But if only youXXXd kept your wits working, youXXXd know the tentXcanXXXt be an eighth of a mile from here.XXXXXXXXConfound it! canXXXt you be exact?XXX Poke teased, with a wink at theXothers. XXXTalking about things that grouch, whatXXXs worse than a fellowXwho deals in eighths of a mile, when he ought to say twelve hundred andXthirty-four ten-thousandths, plus? You vex me, Shark.XXXXXXXXYou--you----XXX snorted the Shark; then words failed him, and he set offXat a round pace.XXThe others followed, weariedly but willingly. Camp and supper wereXpleasing thoughts; and the event proved that about the former, atXleast, the Shark was right. In a moment or two the canvas of the tentXshowed like a pale blur on the dark background. The rest quickenedXtheir steps; but Sam, pausing, looked back.XXAfter all, the fire had started uncomfortably close to the camp. ItXwas borne in upon him that it was a singularly fortunate circumstanceXfor the club that what little breeze there had been had blown in theXopposite direction. If some mischief maker had been at work----XXSamXXXs expression was grave, as he turned and resumed his way. With allXhis desire to be fair in his judgments, an ugly suspicion was obtrudingXitself upon him.XXXXXCHAPTER XIX A DREAM AND AN AWAKENINGXXXTired as he was, Sam was sleeping badly. He was dreaming, and theXdream was peculiarly annoying; for it was very like a repetition ofXthe dayXXXs events, enacted over and over again. He was tramping throughXwoods which seemed to have no end; then he was fighting brush fires,Xwhich broke out anew as fast as he could extinguish them; then heXwas coming back to the camp, and supper was to be made ready, and aXsquabble between Poke and Step over possession of the coffee-pot was toXbe settled half a dozen times; then when his weary mates had stretchedXthemselves out and were already dozing, something impelled him to leaveXthe tent and revisit the scene of the fire. Sam, tossing and turning,Xhad visions of that trip repeated a score of times. Back and forthXhe seemed to be trudging. There was moonlight. In it the tent had aXghostlike effect, while the burned-over tract was a weird scene ofXdesolation. There was nothing to indicate danger of the fire reviving,Xand this was comforting; but the dream, presently, began to includeXstrange and ominous sounds like the beat of great wings, suggestingXdragons and other marvelous creations of unchecked fancy. In his wakingXhours he was not an imaginative chap, but, once his eyes were closed,Xhe could see as wonderful sights as even Poke, who rather specializedXin nightmares, could conjure up. Yes, and he could hear sounds quite asXstrange as Poke ever attempted to describe to a skeptical audience. HeXwas hearing them now; the beat of the wings was almost directly overXhis head.XXSam sat up with a start. He dug his knuckles into his eyes. He peeredXabout him. There was a wavering patch of faint light--that would be theXplay of moonbeams before the tent, he told himself. There were shadowyXforms about him, where the other members of the club lay asleep. TwoXor three of them were breathing heavily; snoring, in fact, like goodXfellows; but he realized that other sounds had awakened him. Then cameXexplanation. The flaps of the tent had been insecurely fastened, andXwere fluttering in a strong, if fitful, breeze.XXSam crawled out from his blankets. He picked his cautious way to theXdoor of the tent, stumbling over somebodyXXXs shoes, but recoveringXbalance and escaping a fall. He looked out. There were scurrying cloudsXoverhead, fleecy clouds which did not completely hide the moon; theXbranches of the trees were swaying in a sharp gust. Half sheltered asXhe was by the canvas, he felt the force of the wind.XXXXXLucky it wasnXXXt blowing this way in the afternoon,XXX he reflected. XXXItXwould have been a bad job, if----XXXXXHe didnXXXt finish the sentence. He had not shaken off the influenceXof the dream, and there was, besides, the ugly doubt concerning theXaccidental cause of the fire. A moment he stood there, trying to setXhis wits in order, as he himself would have phrased it. Then, of aXsudden, he was as thoroughly awake and alert as fresh alarm could makeXhim.XXA thin, grayish vapor was filling the space before the tent. HisXnostrils caught the pungent odor of wood smoke.XXSam wasted no time, once he had warning of the reappearance of theXperil. He sprang back into the tent to rouse his mates; but, even as heXdid so, he was making swift calculation of the hour. The position ofXthe moon gave him his best hint. Midnight had passed; of that he wasXquite sure.XXXXXUp, everybody!XXX he shouted. XXXTurn out! Fire, fire, fire! Hustle! Get aXmove on! The fireXXXs started again, and this time itXXXll travel this way!XUp with you, everybody!XXXXXThere was varied response to the summons. Herman Boyd, a light sleeper,Xseemed to reach awakening and understanding together; for he was outXof bed and on his feet in a second. Tom Orkney sat up and yawnedXcavernously. The SharkXXXs voice rose sharply:XXXXXConfound it all! WhatXXXs the row about?XXXXXXXXRow enough!XXX cried Sam. XXXWoods afire again!XXXXXXXXUmph!XXX growled the Shark; but he reached for his spectacles and havingXput them on, began to wriggle into his trousers most expeditiously.XXThe Trojan and Step tried to rise at once, and collided. Both wentXdown, Step falling across the still recumbent Poke, who groanedXabysmally, and struck out wildly in the dark. Whereat Step, inXself-protection, grappled with his plump friend, and the pair rolledXfrom bunk to ground, adding immensely to the confusion in the narrowXspace.XXFor two or three minutes pandemonium reigned. Then Sam, using voice andXarm vigorously, succeeded in restoring order, of a sort.XXXXXHurry, hurry!XXX he urged; and the exhortation was not wasted. The boysXscrambled into their clothes; they dragged on shoes, without much heedXto ownership of the articles. Poke and Step, freed from each otherXXXsXembrace, made as good time as the rest.XXLed by Sam, the club swarmed out of the tent. Once in the open, thereXwas no need for him to declare the danger. Clouds of smoke were drivingXby them, and beyond the smoke the yellow flicker of flames was visible.XXSam caught up the spade they had used in digging a ditch about theXtent. Step noted the action, and gave a shout.XXXXXHurrah! I know where thereXXXs another--over by the old shed. ItXXXsXbroken, but itXXXll help.XXXXXXXXGet it!XXX cried Sam; and away went Step on the run, bounding alongXwith a queer, kangaroo-like gait, which covered ground amazingly.XXTom Orkney and Herman armed themselves with axes. The Shark took aXhatchet; the others laid hold upon clubs which might be of use inXbeating the burning brush. Then they sallied forth for battle.XXThey had not far to go. Apparently the new fire was close to the tractXburned over in the afternoon; but, except in the matter of locality,Xthe situation was entirely changed. The first fire had started whenXalmost a dead calm prevailed; its spread had been slow. Now a strongXbreeze was blowing, and the line of flame was advancing swiftly. It wasXsweeping toward the camp, and had gained such headway that Sam, at aXglance, realized that the club had its work cut out for it, if it wasXto save the tent and its contents.XXAs has been told, the woods near the lake offered plenty of fuel. SamXand his fellows, charging up to the fire, quickly discovered thatXthe beating-out process, which had served well enough in the earlierXinstance, was no longer effective. Here and there, to be sure, it wasXpossible to check the enemy on a narrow front; but, beyond this, theXleaping, yellow tongues continued to gain on either flank.XXA spectator, free of anxiety for results, could have found the sceneXsufficiently picturesque. The wavering illumination played strangeXtricks with lights and shadows. The moving line of flames suggestedXa march of torch-bearers, straggling and out of step but alwaysXadvancing, even if irregularly. Here a tree-trunk stood out in theXfull glare; there dense, overhanging boughs were like the roof of aXcavern. For a dozen yards, perhaps, the fire seemed to frolic in theXundergrowth; beyond was a stretch where it raged savagely. The windXsent the smoke swirling through the trees, sometimes in great, rollingXvolumes, sometimes whipped to streaming ribbons. Blazing twigs and bitsXof bark sailed away merrily to fall in the thickets and become freshXcenters of destruction.XXThe boys had scant time for such observations, but they did not need toXmake them to grasp the extent of the danger. Their first attack, as hasXbeen related, succeeded in halting the fire for a space of half a dozenXrods; but on both sides the yellow tongues advanced, and, indeed,Xthreatened to creep in behind them. Sam marked this peril. He calledXto Step, who had come up, bringing the broken spade from the old shed;Xand with him fell back to a comparatively open space well behind theXpresent fighting line--and uncomfortably close to the camp, for thatXmatter.XXSamXXXs plan was simple, but held promise. It was a rough and readyXadaptation of the method often used by farmers in fighting grass andXbrush fires by plowing furrows across the track of the approachingXflames, the freshly turned ground, of course, offering no fuel forXthem. The boys had no plow, but with the spades, plied desperately, itXwas possible to dig a shallow trench, which served a double purpose,Xin that it not only broke the continuity of the carpet of rubbish,Xbut gave chance to widen the safety band by throwing dirt from theXexcavation over the dead leaves and branches beside it. By greatXgood fortune there was a sort of pathway along which Sam and StepXcould work, and here they made the dirt fly, while the others didXtheir best to hold back the fire on their immediate front. In thisXthey succeeded, to the extent, at least, of enabling Sam and StepXto complete their XXXsafety zoneXXX for a distance which meant a realXlessening of the danger to the camp.XXPoke, too, had an inspiration. Its source may have been in a quantityXof smoke which he had inhaled, and which forced him to fall back,Xgasping for breath. At all events, as he stood, coughing and rubbingXhis eyes, a flaming brand fell close beside him. In an instant a newXlittle fire was started. Poke was about to stamp it out, when he tookXsecond thought, and permitted it to burn for a moment, not interferingXuntil a patch four or five feet long and half as wide was ablaze. ThenXin vigorous fashion he plied his club. The result was a patch whereXfire would not travel again because fire had already ravaged the littleXspace.XXIt was another instance of hitting upon an old device--that of settingXXXXback firesXXX; but Poke was vastly pleased by his discovery. He shoutedXto his friends, who, to tell the truth, were quite ready to try any newXmove. To put it in military phrase, they had been fighting a rear-guardXaction, which had its discouraging aspects because of steady, if slow,Xretirement; and they rallied with a will to PokeXXXs assistance. TheXsafety zone widened and lengthened; the XXXback firedXXX strips borderingXthe trench extended almost as far as it did. So much accomplished, theXboys paused for a little in their labors. They stationed themselvesXbehind the defenses, whose strength was about to be put to the test.XXThe fire swept up to the barrier. It seemed to beat upon it as surfXbeats upon a beach. There was no need of a lively fancy to pictureXa succession of waves; for with the fluctuations of the wind theXflames rose and fell like so many combers; while the hint of spray wasXcarried out by tiny showers of glowing embers, which sailed over theXobstruction. To these the boys gave prompt attention, with all theXgreater zeal because they saw that they were holding back the mainXfire. Five minutes showed their success in this respect. So far asXthe ditch ran, the great danger was over; they were able to cope withXflying sparks falling behind their line. It remained for the Shark toXgive timely warning of the limits of their success and of the menaceXstill existing on either hand.XXXXXLook! There!XXX He was tugging at SamXXXs arm with one hand and pointingXwith the other. XXXItXXXs getting XXXround us! Whew!XXXXXThe Shark was pointing to the left, but what Sam saw there made himXglance swiftly to the right as well. In both directions was abundantXcause for alarm.XXWhat had happened, and was happening, required little explanation. TheXboys had devoted themselves to blocking the path leading straight toXthe camp, and had been forced to neglect the flanks of their defenses.XThere the fire had an unobstructed way. Already it had lapped the endsXof the ditch, and was moving on, edging in upon the sheltered areaXbehind the barrier. In other words, the camp now was threatened fromXboth sides, if not from in front. Older heads might have foreseenXthe situation, but it is probable that the club, with its availableXforce, had done as much as it could have accomplished with the mostXexperienced leadership. The simple fact was that the fire was too bigXto be fought and beaten by half a dozen boys or men.XXSam kept his head. He made a hurried calculation.XXXXXFellows, weXXXve got to have help. This thing is getting XXXway beyond us.XAnd itXXXs getting beyond a case of saving the camp. ItXXXs going to be aXquestion of stopping the fire before it works around the end of theXlake and reaches the pavilion and the cottages.XXXXXThe Trojan voiced the complaint that was in the minds of all of theXclub: XXXConfound the folks over there! Why havenXXXt they turned out andXgiven us a lift? Fire fightingXXXs everybodyXXXs business.XXXXXXXXIf everybody knows about the fire,XXX Sam amended.XXXXXGeeminy! How can those people help knowing? The smoke is blowing rightXin their direction. Then thereXXXs the glare. They canXXXt all be dead overXthere!XXXXXXXXBut they can be asleep.XXXXXXXXThatXXXs right,XXX Poke broke in. XXXRemember, we were right on the spot,Xas you might say, and mighty little we worried till Sam happened to beXbothered by an uneasy conscience or something. And so----XXXXXSam cut short PokeXXXs philosophical observations.XXXXXNever mind that, now! Step, youXXXd better hustle over to the otherXside of the lake and wake XXXem up. Poke, go along with him, and rout outXany neighbors you can find. The rest of us will stay here and hold backXthe fire as well as we can till help comes. Orkney, take Herman andXthe Trojan and work along to the left. The Shark and I will go to theXright. And Step and Poke, hurry--both of you!XXXXXStep needed no urging. Away he went, on the run, with Poke close at hisXheels.XXXXXCHAPTER XX THE BIG FIREXXXSamXXXs generalship had the virtue, at least, of not attemptingXimpossibilities.XXIt had been shown that by concentrating effort the boys could check theXfire for a comparatively few yards; but it was just as clear that suchXa break in the line of its advance would figure little in the generalXresult. In short, so far as the club was concerned, the fire was out ofXcontrol. It was spreading rapidly. How far it already had extended SamXdid not know. To gain information on this point was one of the reasonsXfor the division of his forces. He had no expectation that OrkneyXXXsXsquad could accomplish more than he set as a task for the Shark andXhimself; and this was to do a sort of picket duty, keeping watch on theXflames, hindering their progress, if possible, and preparing to reportXconditions accurately, when reinforcements should arrive.XXIt quickly became evident that the fire was covering a wide area.XSam and the Shark could catch the gleam of flames far to the right.XSeemingly, though, the progress of the conflagration was mostXirregular. The ground was broken, with many little ravines and smallXswampy patches; the growth varied in density; the wind apparently hadXhad much greater effect in some places than in others. The two boysXmoved along at a fairly rapid pace, for the most part; though theyXhalted now and then to extinguish some blaze in bush or grass tuft,Xwhere a flying brand had fallen. The smoke was annoying rather thanXoverpowering; for while it was rising in great clouds, these wereXcaught by the strong breeze and swept away. By keeping a little backXfrom the fire line the boys found that they avoided the worst of thisXtrouble, most of the smoke passing overhead. Of course, they could notXescape it wholly. Again and again the acrid gray fog closed about them,Xand left them coughing and gasping for a moment, while the air wasXagain clearing.XXBeing bent on observation, Sam pressed on. He made mental note of whatXhe saw, and was little encouraged thereby. It was a big fire, and itXwas going to be bigger still. The chances were excellent that the wholeXdistrict about the end of the lake would be burned over.XXOf a sudden, the Shark plucked at his sleeve.XXXXXLook! XXXMost down to the shore we are.XXXXXSam obeyed the order, and saw that the Shark was right. A tiny bay cutXdeeply into the land, bringing the water within a hundred feet of whereXthey stood.XXXXXThatXXXs all right--gives us a way out,XXX said Sam. XXXIf worse comes toXworst, we can take to the lake.XXXXXXXXUmph! Swimming job--waterXXXs deep all along this shore.XXXXXXXXWell, we can swim, then.XXXXXThe Shark nodded. XXXI guess thatXXXs so, only----XXX Then he broke off;Xstared hard at a clump of brush beyond the cove; whistled shrilly.XXXXXWhatXXXs up?XXX Sam demanded curiously.XXXXXSomethingXXXs moving over there.XXXXXXXXWhat do you mean?XXXXXXXXJust what I say. Something--or somebody--is stirring in that thicket.XXXXXSam peered in the direction indicated.XXXXXI donXXXt see anything,XXX he objected.XXXXXI donXXXt--now. I did see something, though.XXXXXTry as hard as he could, Sam made out nothing except the shadowyXoutlines of the thicket. The light, to be sure, was both faint andXtrickily deceptive; one might easily be misled by a flutter of branchesXin a sharp gust.XXXXXWhat did it look like?XXX he asked.XXThe Shark hesitated. XXXWell--well, it seemed to me somebody wasXwriggling through the brush.XXXXXXXXWe can settle it quick enough,XXX Sam declared. He strode to the clump,Xand as he approached it had a suspicion that he glimpsed a flittingXform vanishing in the darkness a score of yards away. But it was only aXsuspicion; certainly nobody was hiding in the cover he searched.XXXXXWell, what do you think now?XXX he inquired.XXBut the Shark had a new point of interest. He had ranged down to theXwaterXXXs edge, and was staring at an object floating some distance fromXshore.XXXXXBoat--sure as youXXXre alive!XXX he declared.XXXXXSo it is--boat gone adrift!XXX Sam agreed, after a momentXXXs study of theXobject.XXThe Shark meditated an instant. XXXLook here, Sam!XXX he said. XXXTake theXway the windXXXs blowing--make note where that boat is--gives you oneXthing sure: Boat must have been beached just about here.XXXXXXXXYou mean to have drifted as that boatXXXs drifted?XXXXXXXXJust what I mean. Know what my notion is? Well, itXXXs that somebodyXlanded in this cove, left his boat, and went into the woods. When heXcame back a few minutes ago he found that the boat had worked off, andXhad been carried out into the lake by the wind. Then he saw or heardXyou and me coming, and bolted through the bushes. That shows that heXdidnXXXt want to be seen.XXXXXSam nodded. XXXThat sounds reasonable. Only why should anybody be afraidXof us?XXXXXXXXNobody would be--if he wasnXXXt up to something queer. When things areXall right, and square, and aboveboard, everybody tries to pull withXeverybody else in fighting a forest fire. That fellow--whoever heXwas--ought to have joined us. Instead, he got away as fast as he couldXtravel.XXXXXAgain Sam inclined his head in agreement. XXXShark, youXXXre figuring thisXthing out right! I had my doubts if you really saw anybody; but theXboat makes it a different case. And IXXXm going to find out who thatXskulker is. Come on!XXXXXWith that Sam plunged into the woods again, the Shark keeping with him.XThe mystery of the stranger for the moment took precedence over theXtask of watching the fire.XXFor a little the boys kept close to the shore, believing that theXboatXXXs owner naturally would try to work back to the cove, and thenceXswim out to the drifting craft. The Shark had a theory that was justXwhat the stranger had been about to do, when he was frightened off byXtheir appearance; and Sam was disposed to accept it as a reasonableXsupposition.XXFive minutesXXX scouting failed to reveal a trace of the fugitive. ItXshowed, too, that the fire in this quarter had spread more slowly, andXthat the farther the boys advanced, the more distant the flames wereXfrom the shore. The pair halted and took counsel.XXXXXThat chapXXXs escaped--for the present, anyhow,XXX said Sam. XXXWeXXXd betterXbe turning firemen again.XXXXXXXXUmph! IXXXd rather land that runaway,XXX objected the Shark. XXXWhatXXXs moreXto the point, weXXXve a better chance to do it than to stop the fire.XXXXXSam reflected briefly. XXXI guess you may be right,XXX he admitted. XXXAllXthe same, we can try to kill two birds with one stone--watch the fireXand look for that fellow at the same time. And letXXXs be at it!XXXXXAgain the two set out, this time putting the lake behind them andXmoving inland. For a space the growth was heavier and the groundXXXXcleanerXXX--that is, there was less litter of dead leaves and branches.XMoreover, a low ridge for the moment hid the fire, so that there wasXnothing to delay their progress.XXPressing on at a brisk pace, they strained eyes and ears for evidenceXof the strangerXXXs presence. Twice or thrice Sam thought he saw or heardXsomething, but in each case it proved to be a false alarm. Once it wasXa frightened rabbit crossing his path, and again the rustlings mightXhave been made by some smaller woods creature. Presently, though,Xthere was a sound which did not die away in a moment, as the otherXsounds had died, but steadily increased in volume; a peculiar soundXthat was like a low roar. Its explanation was not far to seek. TheXridge bent sharply to the left. The boys rounded the curve, and haltedXaghast at the sight they beheld.XXFor a little the higher ground had concealed the spread of the flames,Xbut now, of a sudden, the pair could view the full fury of the fire.XHere it was burning on a scale far greater than any that had marked itsXprogress in other parts of the woods. The crackling of burning brushXwas quite lost in the roaring of the sheets of flame. The boys seemedXto be looking into a huge furnace, in which trees and logs were swiftlyXbeing consumed. The forward line of the fire was like a moving wall,Xbeing pushed forward by some mighty, if irregular, force. And, as theyXgazed, Sam and the Shark saw great brands caught up by a sharp gust ofXthe rising gale and carried along in gleaming arcs to fall in the dryXtimber beyond. They saw vines burned from trees to which they had clungXand fall, writhing like serpents in their descent; they saw a resinousXpine burst into flame from root to top, as if it were some pyrotechnicXset-piece. A shower of sparks fell close to them; there came another,Xand it was like a fiery rain upon their devoted heads.XXThe boys gave ground. Compared with this conflagration, the fire in itsXearlier stages had been as childXXXs play. It was no longer a question ofXchecking or even hindering its progress. They fell back, reluctantlyXbut helplessly.XXXXXIf--if itXXXs as big--at the other end, they--they wonXXXt be able to stopXit this side of the pavilion,XXX Sam said brokenly.XXThe Shark was the most undemonstrative of mortals, but now he wasXwringing his hands in a queer sort of despair.XXXXXConfound it! It--it isnXXXt fair--a fire like that--it wonXXXt give aXfellow half a chance!XXX he moaned.XXXXXA hundred men would be needed to fight it here.XXXXXXXXThey canXXXt raise half so many to save the settlement.XXXXXXXXBut the other neighbors----XXXXXXXXNot enough of XXXem to do any good. TheyXXXll have to telephone to townXfor help.XXXXXSam considered the case for a moment. XXXThe folks at the pavilion willXthink of that, of course.... And Step and Poke must have roused XXXem byXthis time. ThereXXXs nothing we can do about it.XXXXXXXXNot a thing!XXX said the Shark. XXXAnd our campXXXs as good as done for, IXreckon. Our little stop was all right in its way, but thisXXX--he brokeXoff and waved a hand at the great fire--XXXthis is big business, Sam.XItXXXll burn over everything on this side of the lake.XXXXXXXXIXXXm afraid so,XXX said Sam gloomily. XXXMaybe thereXXXll be time, though, toXwork back and save some of our plunder.XXXXXXXXDoubt it,XXX quoth the Shark crisply. XXXNo harm trying, though,XXX he added.XXSam gave a parting glance at the furnace, and found it raging moreXfuriously than ever. It was a wonderful sight, fascinating ifXterrifying. His fancy stirred; there were before him glowing arches andXlong aisles reaching far back into the woods through which the flamesXhad spread; but in the foreground, where the fire was roaring towardXhim, it was easy to picture a monster of savage destruction.XXXXXI--I--it makes me think of a--a phrase I never really understoodXbefore----XXX he began.XXXXXSure! Same here!XXX exclaimed the Shark. XXXItXXXs--er--er--itXXXs XXXA singedXcatXXX--or XXXA burnt childXXX--one or the other--XXXdreads the fire.XXXXXXXXSamXXXs laugh was a little tremulous. XXXHo, ho! XXXDevouring elementXXX--thatXwas what I was thinking about. But youXXXre on the right track, too,XShark. WeXXXre in a fair way to be singed and maybe burned, if we try toXstay here longer.XXXXX[Illustration: THE BOYS FELT AS IF THEY STOOD BEFORE AN ENORMOUSXFURNACE]XXIt was no more than the truth. So great was the heat that the boys,Xeven though they were at a considerable distance from the leapingXflames, felt as if they stood before the discharge pipes of an enormousXfurnace. Sam retreated a pace. So did his companion. Then, together,Xthey turned and started back toward the lake.XXIt was their intention to keep close to the shore and make their way toXthe camp--if that had still escaped destruction--in the hope of savingXthe effects they had left in the tent, and then to rejoin the others ofXthe club. They made haste, running when the ground permitted; andXcame in sight of the water, with no more serious incident than a tumbleXfor the Shark, whose foot caught on a root. On the lake shore, though,Xthey had a reminder of their still unsuccessful quest of the mysteriousXstranger.XXThere was a clearly audible crashing of brush very near them. BothXboys stopped in their tracks. For an instant they peered into the dimXthickets, whence the sounds proceeded. Then, by a common impulse, theyXsprang forward. The great fire was forgotten, and their one thought wasXto overtake the person who seemed to be in such fear of detection.XXXXXCHAPTER XXI ROUSING THE NEIGHBORHOODXXXStepXXXs long legs carried him over the ground at a great rate, but PokeXdid not fall far behind, when the chums started to rouse the peopleXof the settlement near the pavilion. They hurried through the woods,Xreached the road which wound round the end of the lake, and cameXpresently to a farmhouse, which, naturally enough at that hour, was asXdark as the trees before it.XXStep unhesitatingly turned in at the gate, and steered for the frontXdoor. As his hand touched the old-fashioned brass knocker, however, heXheard a savage growl and then a warning cry from Poke, as a big dogXcame bounding from the shadows near the barn.XXStep gave one lusty stroke with the knocker, then sprang aside to avoidXthe dogXXXs charge. He took a vigorous kick at the animal, which swervedXin time to avoid harm, but also missed its mark; for though it snappedXviciously at the boyXXXs leg, the big teeth failed to meet in his flesh.XStep retreated from the porch, and Poke, picking up a stone--luckily heXhad halted in the roadway--threw it with so sure an aim that the dogXyelped with pain, and marking that these were adversaries not to beXattacked recklessly, began to bound about Step, barking furiously.XXSo far as awakening the occupants of the house was concerned, theXperformance was a great success. Up went a window; a head protruded; aXvoice spoke wrathfully:XXXXXClear out, you vagabones! What you mean by skulkinXXX around at thisXtime oXXX night? Get along with you, or IXXXll set the dog on you!XXXXXXXXHuh! You donXXXt need to set him on us--heXXXs a self-starter, all right!XXXXretorted Poke; but Step achieved practical results.XXXXXFire! Fire! Fire!XXX he shouted at the top of his lungs.XXThe head protruded farther from the window.XXXXXFire? Whereabouts?XXXXXXXXIn the woods--beyond the lake! We saw it, and tried to stop it, butXitXXXs too big for us.XXXXXDown went the window with a bang. There was a momentXXXs delay. The dog,Xapparently regarding the affair as taken over by higher authority,Xwas content to snarl and circle Step at a respectful distance. ThenXthe door opened, and a man came out, pulling on a coat as he came. HeXstrode to higher ground beyond the house, turned toward the lake, andXuttered a startled exclamation.XXThe messengers had followed him to the knoll. There they had a firstXview of the extent of the fire. The glare seemed to light the whole skyXto the west. Here and there the flames were in full sight, while aboveXthem were rolling masses of smoke.XXXXXGee-whittaker! SpreadinXXX like bad news and travelinXXX like Sam Hill!XAnd with this wind blowinXXX----XXX The man broke off in mid-sentence;Xwhistled sharply; turned to the boys. XXXYou two hustle along to theXcottages. Rout out everybody. And say! Tell XXXem from me theyXXXd betterXget word to town. TheyXXXve got telephones, and nowXXXs the time to useXXXXem.XXXXXWith that the farmer started off, taking the road by which Step andXPoke had come; while they, in small need of the counsel he had given,Xran toward the pavilion.XXThe cottage settlement was grouped about the public building.XAltogether there were a score of houses, most of them now occupied forXthe season; so that there promised to be men enough available to make aXconsiderable force of fire fighters. Taking a lesson from their recentXexperience, the boys raised the cry of XXXFire! Fire! Fire!XXX when theyXneared the first of the cottages.XXThe response was prompt. For one thing, there was small need ofXexplanation of the alarm; for from the neighborhood of the pavilionXthere was an unobstructed view of the opposite shore of the lake andXthe extent of the fireXXXs spread. Already the flames were making aXwonderful spectacular display, which served as most effective warningXto the cottagers of the need of haste in forming their fire brigade.XIt was almost like a warshipXXXs crew obeying the call to quarters, soXhurriedly did every able-bodied man turn out for service. There wasXsome confusion, of course. Poke and Step found themselves in the middleXof a little crowd. Two or three were putting questions at once--andXnot waiting for replies. Plainly, the cause of the fire or the preciseXpoint of its beginning was of minor interest and importance, comparedXwith the present danger. There was aimless scurrying to and fro. In oneXof the houses a woman began to shriek hysterically. Then rose a sternXvoice of authority. The boys knew the voice. It was that of Mr. Zorn.XXXXXGet axes and spades! Hogan, youXXXve got a plow--load it in your lightXwagon and hitch up on the jump! Mack, you do the same thing! And,XEd!XXX--his voice rose sharply. XXXEd, I say! Hang it! where is that boy?XXXXXThere was no reply. Apparently the younger Zorn was not present, norXwas his whereabouts known.XXAgain Mr. Zorn called, loudly and impatiently: XXXEd! Ed! I want you!XXXXXThere was a brief silence. Then somebody had a suggestion to make:XXXXXReckon heXXXs started for the fire--boy fashion--got to see whatXXXsXdoing, you know.XXXXXXXXMaybe heXXXs taken a boat and is crossing the lake,XXX somebody elseXhazarded.XXXXXIXXXll go and see,XXX a third volunteered, and ran down to the shore. HeXwas back in a moment or two.XXXXXThereXXXs a boat missing,XXX he reported. XXXLikelyXXXs not EdXXXs off to seeXthe circus. And I donXXXt know but he had the right idea. Looks to me asXif the heft of the fire was straight across from here.XXXXXXXXBut the danger point for us is at the end of the lake,XXX Mr. ZornXdeclared. XXXThatXXXs the way the fireXXXll work around--it wonXXXt jump acrossXthe pond. Wish I knew where that boy was, but--well, itXXXs our businessXto get to business. Come on!XXXXXStep plucked at his sleeve. XXXItXXXs an awfully big fire, sir. We thoughtXat first we could stop it, but we saw we were mistaken.XXXXXMr. Zorn peered at him. XXXYouXXXre one of the crowd camping over there,XarenXXXt you?XXXXXXXXYes, sir--but we didnXXXt start the fire.XXXXXXXXUmph! WeXXXll have to look into that part of it later on. Meant to lookXyou over, but kept putting it off. Now itXXXs too late.XXXXXHe was moving away, but again Step stopped him. XXXItXXXs a big fire, anXawfully big fire. And itXXXs getting bigger and bigger all the while.XMaybe youXXXll need to get help from outside--all the help you can raise.XXXXXMr. Zorn studied the opposite shore and the fiery picture it presented.XThe trees close to the water made a dark fringe, through which heXhad glimpses of the glare of flames, even where the fire itself hadXnot burned its way into clear view. And, as a matter of fact, it wasXnow showing in places which had been dark when the alarm roused theXsettlement. He tried to gauge the rapidity of its spread; he made noteXof the stiff breeze; he knew the tinder-like condition of the woods.XXXXXBoy, youXXXre right,XXX he said curtly. XXXMan-size job this is going toXbe--big enough for all the men we can raise.XXX He turned to the group.XXXXJim, youXXXve got a telephone in your house. Call up the fire departmentXin town, and tell the chief we want all the men he can send us. HeXXXllXknow what apparatus would be of any use. And Joe Briggs!XXXXXXXXHere!XXX said a voice.XXXXXJoe, take my car! Go down the main road, and rout out the folks thatXlive along it. If you can get a load of huskies, with axes and spades,Xturn around and bring XXXem back, and have somebody else carry the call.XBut until you get a load, keep on stirring XXXem up yourself.XXXXXXXXRight-o!XXX replied Joe Briggs, and ran toward the little garage behindXthe Zorn house.XXBetween summer residents and workmen employed on the new buildings, theXvolunteer fire brigade mustered more than a score of men by the timeXlate comers had joined the others. Altogether, it was a miscellaneouslyXgarbed party, just as it was variously equipped for the task in hand.XThere were men completely, if hastily, dressed; there were men inXstrictly emergency outfits. Some carried spades or hoes; others hadXaxes. Half a dozen bore lanterns, the light of which revealed the oddXvariety in the companyXXXs costumes and fire fighting weapons. It wasXevident, however, that a number knew well the business before them, andXit was a very practically efficient little force which Mr. Zorn headed.XXNobody paid much attention to Step and Poke. They had given the alarmXand roused the settlement, and there, seemingly, their functionXended. No guide was needed to find the fire or show the way to reachXit. Off marched the brigade, leaving the chums to follow as theyXpleased. Neither of them, though, was in haste to go. Poke, peeringXquestioningly at Step, discovered that the latter was regarding him inXthe same fashion.XXXXXWell?XXX It was Step who spoke, a curious note in his voice.XXXXXOh, IXXXm wondering,XXX said Poke.XXXXXSame here. And same wonder, I reckon.XXXXXXXXIf itXXXs about Ed Zorn--yes.XXXXXXXXItXXXs about him, and about the boat. And I didnXXXt notice Jack Hagle,Xeither. But his folks are living out here, just as the Zorns are.XXXXXXXXExactly! And those two fellows would be likely to be together inXanything. And if they were out on the lake, they must have seen theXblaze long ago.XXXXXXXXWhat reason would they have for being out at this hour?XXXXXXXXMight be fishing for pout.XXXXXXXXI donXXXt believe it!XXX Step declared.XXXXXI didnXXXt say I believe it,XXX Poke pointed out. XXXItXXXs just aXpossibility. But that isnXXXt the interesting thing, which is: If eitherXof those fellows--or both of them--saw the fire, why didnXXXt theyXrow in at once and notify their people? Something queer there, Step;Xsomething queer!XXXXXXXXYouXXXve said it!XXX cried Step, with conviction.XXObeying the same impulse, the two moved toward the shore. Across theXlake the flames were making a brilliant display, and the field ofXillumination was extending far out over the surface. It was still aXshifting and uncertain light, smoke-dimmed at times and varying as theXwind fanned the fire, but, presently, it enabled them to make out aXfloating object well out from the land.XXXXXHi! Look--straight out from us!XXX Poke exclaimed.XXXXXI see it,XXX Step replied. XXXBoat, isnXXXt it?XXX XXXGuess it must be.XXXXXXXXUmph! Then itXXXs queerer still.XXXXXXXXWhatXXXs queerer?XXXXXXXXThat whoeverXXXs in it didnXXXt give the alarm.XXXXXPoke stared his hardest. XXXIXXXm not sure--I canXXXt make it out forXcertain--but _is_ there anybody in that boat, anyway?XXXXXXXXGive it up. CanXXXt tell from here.XXXXXXXXWell, IXXXm going to find out,XXX said Poke, and ran to the waterXXXs edge.XXTwo or three fishing punts were drawn up on the sand. Poke laid handsXon the nearest and with StepXXXs aid pushed it out until it was afloat.XThen both boys climbed aboard, and picked up the short oars lying inXthe bottom of the boat. Five minutesXXX work put them alongside theXdrifting boat. Step caught its gunwale, and made as careful inspectionXof the craft as was possible in the faint light.XXXXXUmph! Nobody home!XXX he reported. XXXOars laid across the thwarts.XEverything left in order; no water in the bottom. I donXXXt believe itXXXsXa case of anybody tumbling overboard.XXXXXXXXBy XXXanybodyXXX you mean Zorn?XXX said Poke.XXXXXOf course.XXXXXPoke took thought. XXXLooks to me as if he landed somewhere, and didnXXXtXmake his boat secure. And the way the windXXXs blowing--well, itXXXs easyXguessing her line of drift. But, I say, Step! WhatXXXs Zorn doing over onXour side at this time oXXX night?XXXXXXXXLetXXXs find out!XXX cried Step. With the painter of the punt in hisXgrasp he sprang into the other boat. XXXCome along, Poke! ThisXXXll beXhandier to row, and weXXXll tow old Snub-Nose.XXXXXPoke accepted the suggestion. XXXWhereXXXll we head for?XXX he asked as heXsettled himself on a thwart.XXThe question was answered, but not by Step. From the shore came a hail,Xquickly repeated.XXThe boys strained their ears.XXXXXSounds as if it came from near our camp,XXX Step asserted.XXXXXAnd it sounds like Tom OrkneyXXXs voice,XXX Poke added.XXStep made swift survey. XXXTell you what! FireXXXs turned the ends of ourXditch--tentXXXs a goner!XXXXXPoke nodded agreement. He could see that while the fire had not burnedXthrough the timber clear to the shore, it was now very close, inXplaces, to the waterXXXs edge. And one of these places, by his reckoning,Xhad been the site of the camp. He dipped his oar, and Step followedXsuit. The towing line tautened. Even with the drag of the clumsy puntXthe pair were able to make fair headway, so hard did they row and soXdeterminedly.XXThe voice that had hailed them began to give directions. XXXPull withXyour left!... There--thatXXXs enough.... Left again!... Hold herXthere!... Now a bit on the right--as you are, as you are! Steady,Xsteady--no hurry!... Right again! You fellows have got too much powerXon one side.... ThatXXXs the ticket, and here you are! XXXVast rowing!XXXXXSomebody caught the bow of the boat. Step and Poke turned on theirXseats to behold Orkney, knee deep in the water, grinning at them.XThere was a decided increase in the glare from the big fire, and theyXcould make out his face plainly. Back of him, on the sand, were theXTrojan and Herman Boyd, their arms full of blankets and other campingXparaphernalia.XXXXXSaved what we could,XXX Orkney tersely explained. XXXTouch and go gettingXwhat we did, at that.... What are you doing with two boats, though?XNever mind! The ark in back will do for the freight. Chuck the stuffXinto her, fellows!XXXXXThe punt was drawn in and swiftly loaded. Then Orkney and his followersXjoined Step and Poke in the lighter boat.XXXXXYouXXXve stirred up the cottagers, of course?XXX said Tom.XXXXXYou bet we have!XXX Step declared. XXXWe had XXXem going, all right! AndXtheyXXXve sent on the alarm to town. Jiminy! but theyXXXll need everybodyXthey can call in from fifty miles around! But, I say! WhereXXXs Sam?XXXXXXXXHe took the Shark and went scouting yonder,XXX Orkney answered.XXPoke stood up in the boat. He peered long and anxiously at the shore.XXXXXI should think Sam would be working back,XXX he remarked. XXXFire looks asXif it was worse over that way. Those two fellows couldnXXXt fight thatXsort of a whirl any more than they could fight the wind.XXXXXXXXRight you are,XXX said Orkney soberly enough.XXThe boats had drifted away from the beach, and their passengers couldXsurvey a wide stretch of burning woods. Nowhere had the fire quiteXreached the waterXXXs edge, but here and there it had drawn very near toXit. Moreover, such tremendous headway had been gained by the flamesXthat it was clear that the growth along the bank was doomed. WhateverXthe fire-fighters might accomplish would have to be done at the ends ofXthe line.XXXXXSam and the Shark ought to be coming back,XXX Poke said nervously.XXXXI--I--what in the world do you suppose is keeping them?XXXXXXXXDonXXXt know,XXX Orkney said shortly. XXXCourse, they can swim for it--ifXthey have to. But what theyXXXre up to----XXXXXStep didnXXXt wait to hear the end of the sentence, but caught up his oar.XXXXXLetXXXs meet XXXem half-way.XXXXXXXXGood scheme!XXX cried Poke, and dropped back on his thwart. XXXYou steer,XOrkney,XXX he added. XXXThe others can keep the sharpest kind of a lookout.XXXXXWith the punt dragging behind, the boatXXXs pace was very moderate.XSlow as it was, however, the voyagers cruised for perhaps half a mileXwithout gaining clew to the whereabouts of their missing friends. ByXthis time they had passed the limits of the fire.XXOrkneyXXXs face was very grave, indeed, as he guided the boat throughXa half-circle, and the return trip was begun. The light wasXstrengthening; for now some of the trees overhanging the water wereXablaze.XXXXXKeep your eyes peeled for swimmers!XXX he called to Herman and theXTrojan.XXThey nodded, but said nothing; and the boat moved slowly on. StepXand Poke were willing but not finished oarsmen; they splashed waterXrecklessly. The crackling flames were distinctly audible. For a littleXthese were the only sounds on lake or land. Then, of a sudden, thereXwas a shout from both lookouts, which seemed to be echoed from theXshore.XXOrkney swung the boatXXXs head; the Trojan was pointing eagerly atXfigures showing clearly on a sand spit, behind which brush was blazingXlike a great torch.XXXXXSam and the Shark, both of XXXem!XXX he exclaimed. Then his voice roseXshrilly in excitement and amazement. XXXYes, Sam and the Shark, butXJupiter Crickets! See whoXXXre with XXXem!XXXXXXXXCHAPTER XXII A GAME OF HARE AND HOUNDSXXXWhen Sam and the Shark plunged into the brush, it was with full beliefXthat they were close upon the trail of the fugitive. Supposedly,Xtoo, each had heard the same sounds. It was a curious circumstance,Xtherefore, that they did not keep side by side, but almost from theXstart drew apart, a fact which escaped SamXXXs notice for a little. SoXintent was he on the pursuit that he failed to observe that the SharkXwas no longer at his elbow; and discovery of this was delayed until heXbecame aware that the sounds by which he had tried to guide his courseXhad died away. Then, pulling up, he peered eagerly about him. TheXgrowth was dense enough to shut off the glare of the fire, and he couldXmake out nothing but lumpy shadows of thickets and black pillars ofXtree trunks. Even the Shark had vanished in the gloom.XXSam whistled softly, then called. The answer came promptly.XXXXXThis way, Sam! YouXXXre off the track.XXXXXXXXNot a bit of it,XXX Sam retorted. XXXBut where are you trying to go?XXXXXThere was an instantXXXs pause. Then Sam heard twigs crack under foot,Xand, presently, made out the Shark approaching.XXXXXWhat are you waiting for?XXX the younger boy demanded impatiently.XXXXXYou--for one thing,XXX said Sam. XXXWhat did you stray off so for?XXXXXXXXStray yourself! I chased a noise till it stopped. Then I stopped, too.XXXXXXXXSame here! But itXXXs mighty funny----XXXXXXXXHuh! I call it exasperating.XXXXXXXXWe wonXXXt fight over words. What I mean is, in a case like this, whenXtwo chaps whose hearing is all right, spread like the prongs of aXsling-shot--well, itXXXs queer.XXXXXXXXI get you. But thereXXXs one explanation: we must be hunting two fellowsXinstead of one. Each of us got after one, and as they scattered, weXscattered, too.XXXXXXXXBut where are the two?XXXXXXXXTheyXXXve either slipped us or outrun us. Or one may have got away, andXthe other may be hiding within a dozen feet of us.XXXXXXXXItXXXs not impossible,XXX Sam admitted. XXXBut if we search----XXXXXTo the left--but not far--something stirred. Sam sprang in theXdirection of the sounds, which at once grew louder and unmistakable.XThe hunt was on again, and the quarry was fleeing with more thought ofXspeed than of secrecy.XXThe Shark was hard on SamXXXs heels. On they went, recklessly and almostXblindly; for the chase led through dense growth and kept well awayXfrom the fire for a time. It bore toward the lake; turned back; soughtXthe deeper woods. Once their course skirted the forefront of flames,Xand in the glare the boys had glimpses of the fugitive. Then it droveXstraight through thickets they might have thought impenetrable at anyXother time. The country grew more irregular in surface. Twice theyXskirted marshy spots among the hillocks. They climbed low ridges andXdashed down into little valleys. In spite of their best efforts theyXcould not be sure they were gaining. They might be running like houndsXon a fresh scent, but the game was traveling like a frightened rabbit.XYet, though they might not draw up on the fugitive, they were so closeXto him that he no longer had a chance to drop unnoticed and let themXoverrun his hiding place.XXFor a second time they found themselves on the shore. Then the hareXdoubled, and led them in an irregular course toward the broken ground.XAnd now the Shark was dropping behind, but Sam was beginning to gain.XHe could hear the heavy panting of the one who fled before him. AgainXhe had glimpses of the scurrying figure. The light was increasing;Xfor the fellow seemed to be heading straight for the fire. Sam sparedXbreath for an astonished exclamation. He was nearing certainty that heXrecognized Jack Hagle!XXWhy should Hagle take so much trouble to avoid a meeting? Sam puzzledXover the problem even as he ran. He raised his voice and called, notXloudly, to be sure--he lacked wind for a shout--but with sufficientXstrength to make sure that the hail reached HagleXXXs ears. And JackXXXsXonly response was a desperate spurt, which for a moment increased hisXlead.XXDoubt of the otherXXXs sanity seized Sam. Jack now was following a courseXwhich bade fair to carry him right into the heart of the conflagration.XA second call produced even less effect than the first; for HagleXcouldnXXXt spurt again. Sam began to close the gap between them. It wasXto be measured in feet rather than in yards; then it was a case ofXinches intervening between SamXXXs outstretched hand and JackXXXs shoulder.XBut the fire was very near now. The glare was all about them; the heatXwas becoming oppressive; the roar of the flames was in their ears.XXXXXStop! Stop!XXX Sam panted. XXXYou--you crazy loon--whatXXXs the matter withXyou?XXXXXHagle didnXXXt stop. Instead, he dodged. The movement saved him fromXSamXXXs descending hand. He plunged blindly down a slope into one of theXtiny, pocket-like valleys of the region, which at the moment chanced toXbe like a peninsula in a sea of fire; for the brush about it was ablazeXon every side except that by which he entered.XXSam saw the danger, and was convinced that fear must have driven HagleXmad. He checked his pursuit; Jack was running straight into a trap. HeXcalled out, XXXCome back! Come back!XXX but Jack gave no heed. He appeared,Xthough, to wake to the peril. At least, he changed course slightly, toXavoid a miry pool which lay at the bottom of the depression.XXIt was as if Sam were looking into a cup, down the slope of whichXHagle was slipping. He saw the boy stumble, recover balance, slide toXthe very edge of the pool; hesitate for a fraction of a second; beginXto struggle wildly. There was an instant in which Sam failed to graspXthe otherXXXs predicament. Then he perceived that Hagle had been caughtXin the treacherous footing of the bog; that in spite of his franticXefforts to extricate himself he was sinking rapidly; that already heXwas mired to the knees.XXSam knew something of the very real peril of the case; quicksands wereXhardly more engulfing than some of these swampy spots; while the fireXadded immensely to the need of prompt and efficient aid.XXHe paused long enough for swift survey of the hollow, of the treesXoverhanging it, of the advancing flames. By his reckoning there wasXstill time to rescue Hagle, though there was not a moment to waste. HeXcaught a stout branch extending over the pool; clinging to it with oneXhand, he swung himself down the bank. The branch bent under his weight,Xbut it was sound and of tough fibre. With its help he found that,Xkeeping his feet on comparatively firm ground, he could lean toward theXbog and grasp JackXXXs collar.XXXXXSteady, there! Keep your head. Try to work one leg free at a time, andXweXXXll wiggle out, somehow,XXX he encouraged.XXHagle yielded obedience. Whatever he might have feared from Sam was aXtrifle compared with his new, and wholly reasonable, fear of the bogXand the fire. He did his best to carry out orders; of that there couldXbe no question. But it was no slight task which was to be accomplished.XLeft to himself, Jack must steadily have sunk deeper in the ooze, andXeven with SamXXXs assistance he could do little more at first than checkXthe sinking. He caught desperately at roots and brush within reach.XHe floundered almost in the fashion of a novice treading water, nowXbringing a foot to the surface only to feel its mate becoming moreXdeeply submerged. Sam tugged and pulled, now this way, now that,Xtesting at once the resistance of HagleXXXs weight, plus the pull of theXbog, and the elasticity of the bough, which was his own dependence inXthe emergency.XXThen the fire came over the ridge, which formed the lip of the cup-likeXdepression. Sam had realized that this soon must happen, and thatXit had not happened earlier was due to some lucky combination ofXcircumstances, including a greater degree of moisture near the poolXthan on higher ground. Now, though, a fierce gust caught the flames andXswept them along. Little trails of yellow gleamed on the trunk of theXtree nearest him, as the bark caught and blazed up. A heap of woodsyXdebris burst into flame. The heat grew intense. Hagle, in new panic,Xlet go of the brush and clutched wildly at Sam. There was a second inXwhich the branch, bending under its double burden, threatened to break;Xbut, though it creaked dismally, there was no sharp crack of fractureXwhich Sam dreaded to hear. And then, like a most timely reXXnforcementXto a sorely pressed army, came the Shark, panting from his run, halfXblinded by sweat and smoke, but with his brain in perfect workingXorder.XXWhat the Shark did was simple, but it was done quickly. He picked theXbest footing that was to be had--it was none too sure footing, at that.XHe tore off his jacket, tossed an end of the garment within HagleXXXsXreach.XXXXXHi there! Let--let Sam alone and hitch on to this!XXX he shouted,Xbriskly, if brokenly.XXOnce more Hagle obeyed. He caught the coat and clung to it as aXdrowning man might cling to a rope. The Shark braced himself as well asXhe could, and pulled. Sam gave an extra tug at HagleXXXs collar. TheirXcombined efforts began to count. Jack succeeded in freeing one leg fromXthe mire, and in keeping it free. Then slowly but surely he managed toXdraw the other from its imprisonment. The Shark threw every ounce heXhad into a final magnificent pull. Sam at precisely the right instantXrelaxed his grip on Jack, who half fell, half was dragged toward theXShark, went down at full length, floundered frantically--and crawledXand sprawled to firmer ground. The Shark helped him to his feet, andXSam, who had swung himself down from his bough, got an arm about him.XXThere still remained an open path for escape from the fire, thoughXit was clear that this way would soon be closed; for the flames wereXflanking the hollow much as they had surrounded the camp. There wasXno need to urge going while the going was good. Jack did not dare toXlook back, but Sam and the Shark, when they mounted the slope, pausedXto survey swiftly the magnificent, if terrifying, spectacle. Far toXleft and right ran the surf-like blaze, rising and falling in longXbillows, breaking as combers break, with showers of fiery spray drivingXbefore the strong wind. Involuntarily Sam caught his breath. The savageXsplendor of it all laid hold upon him, fascinated him. It was left toXthe Shark to recall him to the practical aspects of their situation byXa speech which, oddly enough, was no more practical than SamXXXs stirringXfancy.XXXXXHuh! Wonder how many millions are going to waste! Geeminy! but IXXXdXlike to figure it out!XXXXXXXXMillions? Millions of what?XXX Sam asked in bewilderment.XXXXXHuh! Thermal units, of course!XXX quoth the Shark.XXXXXTher--ther----?XXX Sam began; checked himself; laughed explosively;Xwheeled and began to lead Jack down the pitch on the farther side ofXthe rise.XXThe Shark followed. He made no effort to resume the discussion, andXseemed to be content to hurry after his companions.XXXXXCHAPTER XXIII AN OLD SCORE SETTLEDXXXSam, the Shark and Hagle made for the lake shore. This was not so muchXbecause of any far-seeing, definite plan, as because this was theXline of least resistance, so to speak, and because the lake itselfXoffered escape, should the fire cut them off from flight by land. HagleXdisplayed utter docility. He had done his utmost to evade capture, but,Xonce in the custody of his pursuers, no lamb could have offered lessXresistance.XXAt this point there was still a fairly broad belt of woods which theXfire had not penetrated, and Sam, presently, slackened his pace. ComingXto a little glade, he pulled up.XXXXXWeXXXre all right now,XXX he told the others. XXXWeXXXve got a breathingXspell--chance to rest and get our bearings.XXXXXJack Hagle sank weakly to the ground. The Shark sat down, and claspedXhis hands about his knees. Sam turned for inspection of theirXposition. There was smoke in the air; the fire was visible throughXthe trees; but by his calculation they could remain where they wereXfor a time without rashness. Either the big fire was serving as aXmighty torch or dawn was coming on; at all events, there was lightXenough in the glade to permit him to make out its extent and even toXmark the expression of his comradesXXX faces. The Shark was again hisXimperturbable self; Hagle was a XXXwreck,XXX as Sam himself phrased it.XXThere was a pause. Sam ended the silence.XXXXXJack!XXXXXHagle raised his head, but didnXXXt answer.XXXXXJack! What made you beat it--run away from us?XXXXXXXXI----XXX HagleXXXs voice was faint and tremulous. XXXI--I donXXXt know.XXXXXXXXRot!XXX snapped the Shark.XXSam motioned to his friend to hold his peace. XXXThen you took a lot ofXneedless trouble, Jack. What was your idea, anyway?XXXXXAgain Hagle failed to respond.XXXXXLook here,XXX Sam argued. XXXYou are making a big mistake. If you had anyXgood reason for being in the woods at this time of night, youXXXd betterXgive it. If you donXXXt, everybodyXXXll believe there was a bad reason. AndXwith this big fire--I say, Hagle, I shouldnXXXt like to be blamed forXstarting it, even by accident.XXXXXXXXBut it was going, when----XXX Hagle began impulsively, but stoppedXabruptly.XXXXXWhen you came across the pond in a boat?XXXXXXXXI didnXXXt say I----XXX Again Jack broke off in the middle of a sentence.XXXXXBut didnXXXt you?XXXXXThe Shark had been chafing on the bit, as it were; and now he spokeXforcefully:XXXXXWhatXXXs the matter with you, Hagle? HavenXXXt you got the backbone of aXrabbit? HavenXXXt you any gratitude? Say, did you ever hear that wordXXXXgratitudeXXX before? DonXXXt you know Sam saved you just now just asXsurely as if heXXXd carried you out of a burning house and down a ladder?XDonXXXt you know that if it hadnXXXt been for him, youXXXd be up to yourXarmpits in that bog by this time, with the fire all around you? If youXdonXXXt know it, I know it, and you can take my word itXXXs true. And toXsee you acting the way youXXXre acting--huh! but itXXXs sickening! GetXthat, and get it straight, will you?XXXXXPerhaps, after all, this treatment was what the case demanded. HagleXcowered under the attack, but when the Shark paused, he raised hisXhead. There was, of a sudden, an air almost of resolution about him.XXXXXI--IXXXll tell you fellows. I know Sam saved me--Sam, and you, Shark.XXXXXXXXRats! Leave me out!XXX growled the youth especially addressed.XXXXXI wonXXXt--I canXXXt! You helped. And I am grateful--I _am_!XOnly--onlyXXX--Jack faltered miserably--XXXonly what is there for me toXtell?XXXXXXXXYou came over in a boat?XXX Sam suggested. XXXWe saw one drifting awayXfrom shore--it was yours, wasnXXXt it?XXXXXXXXI--I suppose so.XXXXXXXXWhy did you come across at night?XXXXXXXXThe fire had started up again. We--I mean, I--I saw the glow. IXhappened to be awake and looked out of the window. So I dressed, andXtook the boat, and rowed over, to see--to see how much of a start itXwas getting. And that--thatXXXs the truth, Sam!XXXXXNeither of his hearers had missed the inadvertent use of the pluralXpronoun. They exchanged swift glances at the betraying XXXwe.XXX The SharkXwould have spoken, but Sam raised a warning hand.XXXXXItXXXs queer, Jack, that you didnXXXt give the alarm to the people in theXcottages.XXXXXXXXIt seems queer now, but--but it--it didnXXXt look like much of a fire.XXXXXXXXMaybe you thought you could put it out?XXXXXHagle squared his shoulders. XXXNo; I wasnXXXt thinking of that part of it.XXXXXXXXThen perhaps you expected to wake us?XXXXXXXXNo; I came across just to--to look at things.XXXXXThere was a little pause. Then said Sam, very quietly:XXXXXJack, taking your word for what you did or didnXXXt do, I donXXXt see whyXyou bolted away from us.XXXXXHagleXXXs shoulders sagged again. XXXI--I guess thereXXXs no--no sensibleXexplanation for that.XXXXXXXXYou didnXXXt try to fight the fire, did you?XXXXXXXXWhatXXXd have been the use? It was too big to tackle.XXXXXXXXYouXXXve nothing more to tell us?XXXXXJack hesitated. XXXNo; I--I guess not,XXX he said at last.XXSam got upon his feet; the Shark also rose.XXXXXWell,XXX said the former, XXXweXXXll talk this over later on. Meanwhile,XletXXXs get along to the shore; this spotXXXll be too hot to hold usXpresently. Come on, Hagle!XXXXXThere was a rustle of brush at the side of the clearing, and a figureXappeared. It came forward confidently. Sam spoke sharply.XXXXXZorn!XXX he said.XXXXXHuh! Who else would it be?XXX growled the Shark.XXJack Hagle had been about to rise, in obedience to SamXXXs call, but atXsight of the newcomer he seemed to change his intention, and pausedXmidway in the movement, resting on his knees. His glance went swiftlyXfrom Zorn to Sam, and then back to Zorn.XXThe Shark wasted no time in courteous preliminaries.XXXXXWhat do you want, Zorn?XXX he asked bluntly.XXXXXNone of your business!XXX the other retorted.XXXXXWhat are you doing here?XXXXXZorn did not pay the Shark the compliment of appearing to hear him.XXXXXHagle, I want you,XXX he said roughly. XXXGet up!XXXXXThen a curious thing happened--curious, that is, according to the ideasXof every boy in the glade. Jack Hagle did not obey his masterXXXs voice.XXXXXGet up!XXX roared Zorn. XXXYouXXXre coming with me, and youXXXre coming on theXjump!XXXXXXXXHold on there!XXX Sam interposed. XXXHagle is going to do as he pleases.XXXXXZorn turned on Sam. XXXYou keep out of this, Parker! DonXXXt you suppose IXsee through your scheme to break up my crowd? You want to get Jack offXby himself, and pump him dry of all he knows and a lot of things heXdoesnXXXt know. And that I wonXXXt stand for!... Hagle, you come with me!XXXXXBut Jack, still on his knees, merely began to whimper weakly. ZornXstrode toward him; found Sam in the way; attempted to thrust himXaside. It was a violent push rather than a blow, but it served just asXeffectively as a challenge.XXSam struck back, and struck hard. The time for the inevitable physicalXclash with his enemy had arrived, the battle which must be foughtXout. The blow caught Zorn on the shoulder. He reeled under its force;Xregained balance; struck, in turn. SamXXXs guard saved him, and inXanother instant the two were at it, in full earnest, fighting ratherXthan boxing, boring in furiously, more intent on inflicting damage thanXon avoiding it.XXIn height, weight and reach they were not badly matched, though suchXadvantage as there was, lay with Zorn. Both had some slight, haphazardXtraining with the gloves, after the customary manner of activeXschoolboys. Both, too, had inklings of the rules; though, to tell theXtruth, neither paid much heed to them. Sam, to be sure, would notXwittingly strike an adversary below the belt, and it is to be recordedXthat Zorn made no attempt, apparently, to get in a foul blow; butXneither bothered himself about the niceties of procedure. Almost at theXoutset they came to a clinch, and staggered about the clearing, lockedXin hostile embrace, and jabbing away desperately. Then Sam, who for allXhis righteous wrath, was the cooler of the two, broke away, because heXfelt that close quarters were profiting him not at all; and there was aXspace, in which the rivals battled almost in full form. And here SamXXXsXclearer head began to avail him. Zorn was getting the worse of theXexchanges. Vaguely he understood this, and charging savagely, succeededXin grappling again with his adversary.XXHagle watched the fight as if spellbound. The Shark looked on,Xcritically, if not without prejudice. He knew that both Sam and ZornXwere far from fresh, and speculated not a little at the vigor of theXcombat. Indeed, in his own coldly mathematical fashion he arrived atXa fairly accurate notion of the power of the feud between the twoXleaders and the strength it gave them in this decisive test. He made noXattempt to interfere. It was one to one, which was fair, mathematicallyXand every other way. If Zorn defeated Sam the Shark felt it might beXhis duty to take up the argument in behalf of the Safety First Club;Xbut Sam was not yet defeated. Nay, he appeared to be getting ratherXthe better of it. So the Shark hastily polished his glasses, assuredXhimself that Hagle continued passively neutral, and gave his undividedXattention to the fight. It was a good fight--no; it was more; it was aXgreat fight!XXJust as there were no seconds, so there were no rounds, no pausesXto regain wind. Both Zorn and Sam were panting heavily. Both wereXbleeding about the mouth, and a lump was forming under SamXXXs left eye.XBut a change was coming in the tactics of each. Zorn was growing moreXfurious, if that were possible; his generalship was more reckless. Sam,Xon the other hand, seemed to be slowing, but the mathematician was notXmisled. Shrewdly enough, he decided that Sam was keeping his head andXbeginning to follow a definite line of strategy, which involved waitingXfor the fateful opening ZornXXXs offensive was almost sure to afford.XXIt came at last, when the Shark was beginning to wonder at SamXXXsXendurance and persistence in the new waiting game. Zorn had struggledXto gain the prized and effective under-hold; had failed to secureXit; had resorted to a rain of blows with one free arm at SamXXXs head;Xhad shifted his plan of attack and tried to wear out his opponent byXbeating a vicious tattoo on his back. Sam, who had been responding inXkind, if not in degree, to these attentions, felt a slackening in theXgrip of the arm Zorn still had about him. He made a feint of breakingXaway; followed it with a renewal of his more than bear-like hug ofXhis adversaryXXXs body. He worked an arm down to ZornXXXs waist-line; heXdrove his chin into ZornXXXs shoulder. Zorn began to give under thisXleverage. Sam threw all his force into the assault. Back of it was theXdetermination which springs not only from a belief in the justice ofXa cause, but also the accumulated score of endured wrongs. To his ownXsurprise he found a curious accession of strength, as if from someXunsuspected reservoir. There was a moment in which Zorn was thoroughlyXoutclassed and outmatched, and in that moment he went down, fallingXheavily and with Sam still gripping him crushingly.XXThe end of the fight was in sight, but had not yet arrived. Zorn,Xfacing defeat, struggled madly. Sam pressed his hard-won advantage.XHe knew his adversaryXXXs stubbornness; he did not underrate his grit.XZorn fought till he was beaten, decisively, utterly. And then, withXSam astride his prostrate body and SamXXXs fist menacing his head, heXsullenly yielded. It was a bare movement of the eye-lids which answeredXthe decisive demand.XXXXXHad enough? Give up?XXXXXRuefully Zorn gave the sign, which told as much as volumes could tell.XSam sprang to his feet, and stood prepared to renew battle, shouldXthe other break parole. But Zorn, in truth, had had enough, and toXspare. Slowly and painfully he got upon his feet. He stood, silent forXa moment, glancing first at Hagle and then at Sam. Jack rose from hisXknees. He took a step toward Sam, paused, turned to Zorn.XXXXXEd, I--I----XXX he began.XXXXXGo with him, if you want to,XXX Zorn said dully. XXXWhatXXXs the differenceXwhat you do--now? IXXXm whipped. IXXXm down and out. Do as you please.XXXXXJack was trembling. XXXI--I donXXXt know----XXXXXXXXI do then!XXX said Zorn. XXXI know when IXXXm beaten. He--he thrashed me--IXcanXXXt get away from that.XXXXXXXXWell, what you got was a good while coming,XXX said the Shark testily.XXXXOverdue account, IXXXd call it.XXXXXXXXI didnXXXt think Parker had it in him,XXX Zorn went on. XXXIXXXd been waitingXfor this chance at him ever since he refused to trade. And this--thisXhas smashed everything. IXXXm whipped. You three know it to-day. The clubXwill know it to-night, and the whole school and the whole town willXhear of it to-morrow.XXXXXXXXYou donXXXt expect us to keep it a secret, do you?XXX queried the Shark.XXZornXXXs answer had all the surprise of the unexpected. XXXI donXXXt wantXit kept secret; I want it told--just as it is. I mean it! Look here!XYouXXXve got your ideas; IXXXve got mine. Maybe they donXXXt agree allXaround, but if a fellow can whip me, I wonXXXt try to rob him of theXcredit. IXXXm no squealer. I wonXXXt try to take away ParkerXXXs credit.XXXXXXXXAs if that wasnXXXt just what youXXXve been trying to do for a month!XXX theXShark objected.XXXXXI had a reason.XXX There was a curious patience in ZornXXXs tone. XXXI wasXplaying my game. Things happened my way--so I could make use of them. IXdid use XXXem.XXXXXSamXXXs bewilderment at the marked change in his antagonist was beginningXto pass. It could not be said that he yet understood clearly the courseXZorn was taking; but he was getting glimmerings of the truth. DefeatXin fair fight spelled disaster for ZornXXXs plans for school dominance.XZorn recognized this. What was more, he was accepting his reverse withXa fair-mindedness, so to speak, for which Sam was hardly prepared. ItXmust be, he reflected, that Zorn had his code, which might not be theXcode of the Safety First Club, but which he would uphold even at costXto himself; he might not hesitate to do unscrupulous things to achieveXa definite result, but if he failed, he would accept responsibility forXhis methods.XXA cloud of smoke drove across the clearing. Sam was reminded of theXdanger which still threatened them.XXXXXCome on, you fellows!XXX he said, and moved toward the lake shore.XXThe Shark followed him at once. Hagle glanced questioningly at Zorn.XXXXXI--I--we ought--ought to clear it up--everything,XXX he faltered.XXZorn nodded. XXXIXXXm willing--if you are,XXX he said.XXXXXIXXXve wanted to--for weeks!XXX cried Jack.XXXXXThen weXXXll do it!XXX Zorn told him with decision; and strode after SamXand the Shark, Jack Hagle trotting at his heels.XXXXXCHAPTER XXIV WHEN THE TRUTH COMES OUTXXXSam led his little party straight to the waterXXXs edge, and there almostXat once caught sight of the boat with the punt in tow.XXThere was no waste of time in explanations while the rescuing craftXdrove shoreward, or while the four were scrambling aboard. Then StepXand Poke backed away from the beach, not resting on their oars untilXthe boat was perhaps a hundred yards from the land.XXThe presence of Zorn and Hagle, SamXXXs battered countenance, a notXwholly convincing increase in the SharkXXXs indifference of manner--noneXof these things escaped the observation of the other members of theXclub. There was light enough for such study; all along the shore wereXblazing beacons, huge if smoky torches. The spectacle afforded by theXfire, indeed, was now at its finest, and the boat gave a splendid viewXof the long, fiery line and its weirdly reflected splendors on theXsurface of the water; but Orkney, Step, Poke, Herman and the TrojanXgave a dozen thoughts to Sam and his adventures to one bestowed on theXconflagration so near at hand.XXXXXWhew! ThatXXXs what I call a real flare-up,XXX Step declared, but with noXmarked enthusiasm.XXXXXOur campXXXs gone, of course?XXX queried Sam.XXXXXYes. We saved some of the truck, though.XXXXXXXXAnd you woke up the folks across the lake?XXXXXXXXYou bet we did! They sent to town for help.XXXXXThere was a pause in the talk. Hagle, unhappily aware of theXinterested, if unobtrusive, scrutiny to which he was subjected, satXwith bowed head. Sam glanced at him doubtfully. The cowering youth wasXin marked contrast to Zorn who sat erect, and whose expression wasXdetermined, if not defiant. The pair had a story to tell, a story theXclub was eager to hear, but how was it to be begun?XXStep precipitated matters.XXXXXSay, Sam! Picked up company, didnXXXt you? We--Poke and I--we figuredXsomebody was in the woods besides our crowd.XXXXXAt that Jack raised his head. XXXLook here, you fellows!XXX he began.XXXXYou--youXXXve got to know things. IXXXll start at the beginning. You knowXall the trouble started when the Latin book--TrojanXXXs book--was foundXin the desk after the examination. Well, I put it there--and I left itXthere!XXXXXXXXYou did--_you_!XXX Step blurted incredulously. XXXWhy, I supposed----XXXXThere he broke off, and glanced significantly at Zorn.XXXXXI put it there, and I left it there,XXX Jack repeated.XXXXXAnd then let Trojan stand the blame?XXXXXXXXI--I, somehow, couldnXXXt help letting him stand it.XXXXXXXXBut one word from you----XXXXXXXXI know, I know! Only I--I couldnXXXt manage to say it,Xbecause--because----XXXXXXXXBecause I wouldnXXXt let him,XXX Zorn put in. XXXThatXXXs my part of theXbusiness; I shoulder the responsibility.XXXXXThere was a stir among the club members. Tom Orkney edged nearer Zorn,Xbut Sam spoke quickly:XXXXXLet Jack tell the story--his end of it, anyway.XXXXXZorn shrugged his shoulders. XXXAll right! Let him go ahead. I wonXXXt tryXto stop him.XXXXXXXXHereXXXs what happened,XXX Hagle went on. XXXEvery fellow in the classXknew the bully, good notes written in the TrojanXXXs Cicero. Out in theXhall, before we went into the room, I saw Sam borrow the book, andXgive it back to Trojan. Then I saw him put it against the wall. Now,Xthere was one special passage--I just had to have a look at it. So IXslipped over and grabbed the book. But then the crowd started into theXroom, and I--well, before I knew it I was going in, too. And there wasXthe book! I couldnXXXt let it be seen. So I slipped it under my coat.XIXXXll be honest--maybe I had a notion of getting a peek at it afterXwe received the question paper. Anyway, I shifted it to the desk asXsoon as I could. And I left it there. I--I got frightened. The teacherXseemed to be keeping a close watch, and when the hour was over and weXwere dismissed, I didnXXXt dare risk getting it out of the desk and backXunder my coat. And I didnXXXt think--didnXXXt dream--thereXXXd be troubleXfor anybody. And I meant to go back for it after school, when nobodyXwas around. I did go back, but the door of the room was locked. AndXthen--then--well, then, I sort of let things slide. But I didnXXXt meanXto bring harm to anybody.XXXXXHis voice rose shrilly as he repeated this claim of lack of maliciousXintention. He waited a moment, as if in hope that some of the clubXwould express acceptance of this view, but none of them spoke. Then heXwent on, hurriedly and not too coherently:XXXXXOf course, I didnXXXt want to get anybody else into a mess. I--IXwouldnXXXt have helped to do it if--if I could have helped myself. He--heXmade me, though. And the way it all happened--why, somehow, I couldnXXXtXseem to do anything right. He--he had seen me take the book in. He justXjoked me a little about it at first, but afterward--after the facultyXbegan to poke around--he came down on me like a thousand of brick. TheXthings heXXXd do to me if I didnXXXt follow his lead! I--IXXXd always beenXsort of afraid of him, but now--well, he was different and worse--aXlot worse. And then he mixed in soft soap and promises. HeXXXd do thingsXfor me, all sorts of things. IXXXd be right in with the right crowd.XAnd weXXXd run the school! And the way it all worked--you saw that?XXXXHe turned appealingly to Sam, who nodded. XXXIt was queer. When theXprincipal was asking his questions, it seemed as if all I had to do wasXto say as little as I could, and let everything drift. And then he gotXme in a corner and----XXXXXXXXOh, out with it!XXX said Zorn. XXXYouXXXre talking about me, now. Make itXplain. I got you in a corner, you say. Well, go on.XXXXXHagleXXXs voice trembled, but he obeyed. XXXEd put it this way: he wentXlight on the Trojan, and heavy on Parker and the club. He declared SamXhad as good as given Trojan away, and said a lot about your crowd beingXyellow. And he said you had played into our hands. And he told me heXcould straighten everything out after a while, when weXXXd got what weXwanted.XXXXXThere the Shark intervened. XXXHow was he going to straighten thingsXwithout showing you up?XXXXXXXXI--I donXXXt know--I never understood.XXXXXXXXNo; I donXXXt think he did,XXX Zorn corroborated. XXXI had him bluffed. HeXwas afraid of me. As it was, though, once or twice I had to rough himXto keep him up to the mark.XXXXXXXXLook here!XXX It was PokeXXXs turn to question. XXXRemember that day I wasXtrying the flying machine and ended by almost running into you two? ItXseemed to me as if I was breaking into one of those thrashing bees.XXXXXXXXI remember--and you were right,XXX Hagle testified. XXXHe hadnXXXt trustedXme altogether after I voted for Trojan at the election. But I--I justXhad to do that! I was mighty sorry for Trojan. And the more I thoughtXit over, the worse I felt. Ed kept a close watch on me. He made meXtrail XXXround with him; he made me do things with him.XXXXXXXXLike starting that?XXX Sam asked sharply; and waved a hand at the greatXfire.XXXXXNo!XXX cried Jack and Zorn in a breath.XXXXXWe had nothing to do with starting it,XXX Zorn added emphatically.XXHagle was shaking his head. XXXNo, we didnXXXt set that going, Sam. Ed wokeXup and saw the glow, and came over to our house, and threw pebbles atXmy window till I woke up. Then we took the boat and crossed the lake toXsee what was happening. The boat drifted off. It was gone when we cameXback to where we had landed. Then you came along, and--well, we didnXXXtXwant you to see us; for youXXXd think, of course, weXXXd set the woodsXafire. And it wouldnXXXt have been easy for us to explain being there.XAnd so we ran--and, well, you know the rest of it.XXXXXSam reflected a moment. XXXJack,XXX he said, XXXif I take your word about theXsecond fire, and agree that it must have been the first breaking outXagain when the wind rose, how about the first itself? That first fireXwas very close to our camp. All of us had been away all day. And thatXfire wasnXXXt due to spontaneous combustion.XXXXXXXXI--I donXXXt know how it started.XXXXXXXXWere you--you and Zorn, or either of you--on this side of the lakeXthis afternoon?XXXXXHagle cast an unhappy glance at Zorn, who made answer for him:XXXXXYes, we were across--both of us.XXXXXA murmur rose from the club.XXXXXWe were across; we saw the fire,XXX said Zorn steadily. XXXBut weXdidnXXXt start it. It was going when we came along. Who set it, then?XNobody--intentionally; at least, thatXXXs my idea. You see, there areXpeople going through every now and then; sometimes the workmen takeXan afternoon off and wander around. Then there are fellows on fishingXtrips. Some of them are careless with matches and cigar stubs. SomebodyXwas careless to-day--anyway, thatXXXs my theory.... And the fire wasnXXXtXmuch of a blaze when we saw it.XXXXXXXXDid you try to put it out?XXX Sam asked.XXHagle hung his head, but Zorn spoke as steadily as before.XXXXXNo; Jack made some motions, but I stopped him. DonXXXt need to tellXme it was near your camp. I saw that. Yes, and I knew it was on myXfatherXXXs land. And if youXXXd like the whole truth, you can have it. AllXalong IXXXd been letting appearances count against you fellows. Well,Xhere was just another chance of the same sort. I figured the fireXcouldnXXXt do much damage in almost a calm, and probably you could putXit out when you happened along. But the burned-over place would makeXa fine exhibit to show to my father, to prove the danger of havingXcampers in the woods.... Anything more youXXXd like to know?XXXXXXXXYes, thereXXXs a million things!XXX cried Step impetuously. XXXYou--you tellXus----XXXXXSam stopped him with a sharp, XXXWait a minute, Step!XXX then turned toXZorn.XXXXXYouXXXve gone out of your way to cause us a lot of trouble. What was allXthe scheming for?XXXXXThere was frank surprise in ZornXXXs face. XXXWhy, I told you once, Parker!XDidnXXXt you understand? I wanted your backing--your clubXXXs backing. IXcouldnXXXt get it by favor, so I tried to capture it by force.XXXXXSam recalled LonXXXs suggestion. XXXYou thought youXXXd work a sort ofXcrooked political game on us, didnXXXt you?XXXXXXXXThatXXXs it!XXX shrilled Jack Hagle. XXXEd always is talking about storiesXheXXXs heard about political tricks!XXXXXThere was light enough to see the red come into ZornXXXs cheeks.XXXXXWell, hasnXXXt a fellow got to have some interest in life?XXX heXdemanded. XXXAnd if I _have_ heard how things are worked, why shouldnXXXt IXmake use of the hints? Politics? Why, yes--if you want to call it that.XXXXXXXXBut thereXXXs such a thing as straight politics, honest politics,XXX saidXSam.XXXXXCertainly! If there wasnXXXt the right kind, the countryXXXd go to smash,XXXXthe Shark contributed. XXXJust like mathematics! You may make mistakes,Xbut if you stick to it and keep to the rules, youXXXll get the rightXanswer in the end. Same way with parties. After allXXXs said and doneXtheyXXXve got to play fair and work straight, or they go to smash.XXXXXXXXSame as ZornXXXs schemes!XXX Step put in, bluntly.XXZorn sat straighter; he faced the club, and spoke with a curiousXdeliberation:XXXXXIXXXve got to take my medicine--I know it. WhatXXXs more, I want to. YouXdonXXXt understand, maybe, but itXXXs the fact.... Now, things have hit meXhard to-night. See here! I have had schemes, as you call them. What wasXI after? Why, to be top-notcher, first all around, head of the school.XAnd I saw how to make it. I must get backing; I needed yours. I sawXI couldnXXXt have it by favor, but luck gave me a chance to put on theXscrews.... Then to-night Sam Parker thrashed me--out-fought me. It wasXa fair fight. He beat me, and IXXXm not whining. I didnXXXt think he hadXit in him, but he had.... When I went down, though, everything wentXdown with me. Look here! Maybe, when you were youngsters, you playedXwith toy soldiers. You stood XXXem in line. If one was knocked over, allXof them tumbled. ItXXXs the same thing in my case now. DonXXXt you see it?XI set out to be cock of the walk. I figured I could whip any fellowXin school, if I had to. Well, Sam Parker whips me--and down plump allXmy play-things! I canXXXt be the all-round top-notcher; for IXXXve met aXbetter man. The whole school gets the story; the crowd quit me. ThereXyou have it! First in everything, or first in nothing. ThatXXXs the game,Xas IXXXve played it. IXXXm down and out.XXXXXXXXSo--so am I--but IXXXm glad of it!XXX cried Jack Hagle. XXXYou donXXXt think,Xdo you, IXXXve been having a good time? You donXXXt think I havenXXXt beenXmiserable? I donXXXt care whatXXXs done to me! It canXXXt worry me asXawfully as what IXXXve been through has worried me--day and night!XExpulsion--jail--anythingXXXll be better!XXXXXSam glanced at the Trojan. The fellow who had suffered most by theXplot had said not a word, while the trickery, of which he had been theXvictim, was being revealed. Others of the club, too, were looking atXWalker, questioningly, wonderingly. Sam cleared his throat.XXXXXAhem, ahem! I--I say, Trojan, whatXXXs your idea--of the right thing,Xyou know?XXXXXBut the Trojan shook his head. XXXSam,XXX he said slowly, XXXSam, I leaveXit to you and the crowd. You know, all along IXXXve felt I didnXXXt haveXa fair deal--itXXXs been that that cut me worst. WhateverXXXs done now,XI want to be the square thing--no more, no less. And whatXXXs fair andXsquare IXXXm not the one to say--IXXXve been hit too hard. I leave it toXyou, Sam--you and the club.XXXXXXXXAnd so do I!XXX cried Jack Hagle.XXSamXXXs glance went to Orkney, to the Shark, to Step and Poke, and toXHerman Boyd. But it was Zorn who put their verdict into words.XXXXXItXXXs up to Hagle and me to undo the harm, so far as we can. WeXXXllXhave to clear Trojan--thatXXXll mean going to the principal.XXXXXXXXIXXXll do it!XXX Hagle declared.XXXXXWeXXXll let the class have the straight story--thatXXXll be my job, IXguess. And about the fire--both of us will be ready to testify youXcould have had nothing to do with starting it. Anything else?XXXXXSam shook his head slowly. XXXI donXXXt think of anything else now.XButXXX--he paused, conscious of a new feeling for Zorn, not a liking butXa feeling lacking much of the old bitterness--XXXbut this is going to beXpretty tough for you, Ed.XXXXXXXXThatXXXs my affair,XXX said Zorn. He said it simply, evenly, with no traceXof gruffness. And Sam understood. They had found the admirable partXof ZornXXXs code: as he himself might have said, heXXXd take his medicineXwithout whimpering.XXXXXCHAPTER XXV VINDICATIONXXXIn twenty-four hours the big fire had burned itself out. A smartXthunder shower, followed by a soaking drizzle, breaking the longXdrought, helped to check it; just as the valiant labors of theXsettlement men, reXXnforced by farmers of the neighborhood and drafts ofXtown firemen and volunteers, counted in preventing its spread aroundXthe end of the lake to the pavilion and cottages. But, as a matter ofXfact, the lake itself and an inlet penetrating deeply into the shoreXwere the most effective checks. Here the fire burned to the waterXXXsXedge, and stopped because it there found nothing more to burn; butXfor a day, in spite of the rain and the efforts of the fire brigade,Xacrid clouds of smoke hung over the blackened area, proof that in theXaccumulated woods waste there were still smouldering embers. In theXend, of course, these lingering fires died out, and the smoke cloudsXthinned and vanished; and there was left a scene of desolation andXdestruction, a stretch of gaunt, charred and leafless trees rising outXof a mass of gray, ash-strewn debris.XXXXXKinder melancholy foreshore for them summer folks to beXcontemplatinXXX,XXX Lon philosophized. XXXStill, they donXXXt have to lookXat it, if they donXXXt want to. And theyXXXve got their nice little,Xfancy-painted houses left, and thatXXXs good luck for them. And inXanother year or two, the stuffXXXll be growinXXX green again--old NaturXXXXis like Charity in coverinXXX a multitude oXXX sins--and except for theXbean-pole effect of the dead trunks, things wonXXXt be so distressinXXX.XNo; the lake shoreXXXll be mended a good long while before someXreputations is--eh?XXXXXSam was of the same opinion. It would be a long, long time beforeXpeople forgot the performances of Ed Zorn and Jack Hagle. Zorn hadXcarried out his pledge. He had gone among his classmates, and hadXcleared the slate for Trojan and Sam and the Safety First Club. He hadXtold his father all he knew of the fire. And then he had dropped out.XIt was no surprise to Sam to learn, one morning, that Zorn had left theXschool and the town for a time. It was rumored that his father hadXdespatched him to an institution, which was celebrated for its strictXdiscipline, and which continued its term through the summer. In hisXcase out of sight did not mean out of mind, but it did mean that at theXschool affairs could go on, undisturbed by rash ambition and recklessXstriving for honors.XXHagleXXXs case was not to be disposed of so simply. When Sam led him toXthe principal, he made good his promise of clearing the Trojan. HeXoffered no excuses, but the principal guessed shrewdly at the extent ofXthe evil influence Zorn had exerted upon the weakling. Hagle was notXexpelled, but the sentence imposed upon the Trojan was shifted to hisXshoulders, with the addition that his recitation marks were canceledXfrom the day of the test. It meant flat failure for him in the LatinXfor the term, and consequently the loss of a year--but Jack made noXcomplaint. He told Sam that he felt he was getting off easily, asXindeed he was; and he added, truthfully enough, that his greater easeXof mind, now that justice was done, was worth all its cost, and more.XXThe principal asked Sam to remain after Hagle had gone. He studied theXboy meditatively, and with a hint of distinct esteem.XXXXXParker,XXX he said, XXXI donXXXt, as a rule, ask pupils to sit as judge orXjury; but, in this instance, IXXXm moved to seek your opinion. Frankly, IXthink you have won a right to be consulted. Now, as to Walker----XXXXXSam waited for him to finish the sentence; perceived that he had noXintention of doing so; spoke what was in his heart, and spoke plainly:XXXXXThe thing that cut Trojan deepest, sir, was that he didnXXXt get aXsquare deal--I mean, thatXXXs how he felt. And I felt the same way. YouXcan see for yourself now how things worked out to give us the worstXof it. So it seems to me, sir, Trojan ought to come in for just theXsquarest sort of a deal that can be given him. Of course, I donXXXt knowXhow Mr. Bacon may----XXXXXAt mention of the sub-master, who had conducted the inquiry, theXprincipal made a movement, slight but perceptible. Somehow, Sam knewXthat his old suspicion had been justified, that the head of the schoolXhad not approved the course taken by his assistant.XXXXXMr. Bacon is not presently concerned in this matter,XXX said theXprincipal. XXXYou and I are discussing it--and only you and I. I believeXon a previous occasion we agreed on the desirability of doing essentialXjustice. But what is essential justice in this case?XXXXXXXXClearing TrojanXXXs name to begin with?XXXXXXXXCertainly.XXXXXXXXThen, putting him back where he was in his classes--fixing it so thatXhe doesnXXXt lose his standing.XXXXXXXXWhatXXXs the situation--with his studies, I mean?XXXXXSam told him what the club had done to tutor Trojan in Latin, and toXencourage him to keep up his work in the other branches.XXXXXOf course, sir, heXXXs naturally had the snap knocked out of him,XXX heXadded. XXXThis thing has hurt his rank all around. He--well, he didnXXXtXcare: he kept at it more to oblige us than for his own sake. And--well,Xthere ought to be some allowance made on that score.XXXXXThe principal looked thoughtful. XXXGo on, Parker,XXX he said.XXXXXAs for the Latin--now, sir, it seems to me he ought to be put backXwhere he was, given the mark he made on that paper, and allowed atXleast his average for the time he couldnXXXt go to class. And when heXtakes the final examination, it would be only fair to give him someXleeway--weXXXre not crackerjack tutors, any of us, you know.XXXXXThe principalXXXs eyes twinkled. XXXParker, knowledge of what one wantsXis an advantage at times. ItXXXs quite an order of yours, but--IXXXveXtaken the trouble to investigate WalkerXXXs record from his entrance.XAnd IXXX--he bent forward and dropped his voice--XXXIXXXm going to tellXyou something--in strict confidence, understand. If Walker will showXreasonable industry for the brief balance of the term--why, I canXassure you it will require considerable ingenuity on his part to failXto meet my requirements--all around--on this yearXXXs work. Is thatXsatisfactory to you?XXXXXIf the principalXXXs eyes had twinkled, SamXXXs glistened. XXXItXXXs more thanXsatisfactory, sir--itXXXs bully!XXX he cried; and with an impulsivenessXhe rarely displayed he caught the otherXXXs hand, gripped it hard, and,Xturning, dashed out of the room to carry the tidings to the club.XXThe boys received the news as good news--the best of news--butXeach received it in his own way. The Shark said XXXHuh!XXX and blinkedXfuriously behind his big spectacles. Tom Orkney wrung SamXXXs hand. PokeXchuckled joyously; Step threw his hat in the air; Herman Boyd turned aXcartwheel. As for the Trojan, after all the chief in interest--well, heXvery, very nearly broke down. Probably none of his friends--not evenXSam--realized how hard he had been hit, or how the belief that he hadXbeen dealt with unfairly had rankled. At times some of the boys hadXfelt that he had been too passive in accepting rather than assisting inXtheir efforts in his behalf; but now the Trojan left them no ground forXcomplaint. With his reputation cleared, he threw himself with an energyXwhich was almost ferocious into the task of making up lost time andXpreparing for the closing examinations.XXXXXI donXXXt want to be carried through them; I want to go through them onXmy own feet!XXX he declared to Sam, tersely and most earnestly.XXAs has been related, the school and the town learned more or less ofXwhat had happened, though the Safety First Club issued no bulletins.XAnd the former made haste to revise its judgment of the Trojan, andXSam, and their friends. The triumph, in fact, was complete to theXpoint of embarrassment. There was something very like an ovation forXthe Trojan in the schoolyard, and a cheer, ragged but enthusiastic,Xwas raised in SamXXXs honor--and to his vast discomfort. From far offXJack Hagle looked on. He was practically an outcast now, shunned byXeverybody, but prevented from following ZornXXXs example and fleeing theXscene of his discomfiture; but Hagle, be it said, weakling though heXwas, was happier doing his penance than he had been as the tool of theXmasterful Zorn.XXLon perhaps made the best summary of JackXXXs case, his remarks beingXaddressed to the assembled club, gathered of a showery afternoon in theXParker garage. There had been some good-natured jests at the expenseXof Poke, who recently had brought in the salvage from the Saracen,Xand who was understood to be meditating further experiments in motorXtransportation, about which he declined to be communicative.XXXXXMaybe I have an idea, but IXXXm not advertising it,XXX he remarked.XXXXIXXXm going to take my time this trip. You see, the trouble with theXSaracen, IXXXll always maintain, was because I tried to fly just a weeXtoo quick. As it was, we _did_ fly--a little; otherwise, howXXXd we haveXgot over that wall and into the road? No; I donXXXt say thereXXXs going toXbe another aeroplane; but, whatever it is, IXXXm not going to hurry tooXmuch. You see, I learned something, anyway, from that experience.XXXXXThis seemed to give Lon his text.XXXXXIXXXm right down sorry for that Hagle boy,XXX he said. XXXStill, thereXXXsXmore or less oXXX whatXXXs called alleviatinXXX circumstances. HeXXXs like aXfeller thatXXXs been needinXXX a bath mighty bad, but when he gets one,Xfinds heXXXs in awful hot water. And he squirms, and wriggles, andXsweats, but all the while itXXXs doinXXX him a heap oXXX good. Why? BecauseXheXXXs gettinXXX clean. And when the dirtXXXs good and thick and caked on, asXyou might say, it takes a real bXXXilinXXX out to start it good and proper.XBut I reckon HagleXXXs gettinXXX his laundryinXXX all right. HeXXXs doinXXX well,Xto date. The next pXXXint is for him to come out of it with a backboneXstarched till thereXXXs some stiffness in it. And if that happens--well,XitXXXll be wuth to him all it cost--and a leetle more. What say to that?XXXXXHe might have read agreement in all the faces before him, but nobodyXput the answer into words.XXLon chuckled softly. XXXWell, then, if none of youXXXs moved to giveXtestimony, IXXXll say it again: this thingXXXll be wuth to Hagle all itXcost--and then some--if it makes a man of him. ThatXXXs the truth, andXtruthXXXll bear repeatinXXX. ThatXXXs about the best way there is oXXX makinXXXXsure it is the truth.... Tell you what, boys! TruthXXXs bound to come outXtop oXXX the heap!XXXXXSeveral heads nodded; but Poke spoke, meditatively, if not doubtfully:XXXXXI know--only sometimes it doesnXXXt seem to come running.XXXXXXXXOh, thatXXXs jest because it happens to have a long way to go in someXcases,XXX said Lon impressively. XXXBut it gets there every time--yessiree,Xevery time!XXXXX       *       *       *       *       *XXThe Stories in this Series are:XX  THE SAFETY FIRST CLUBX  THE SAFETY FIRST CLUB AND THE FLOODX  THE SAFETY FIRST CLUB FIGHTS FIREXX       *       *       *       *       *XXTranscriberXXXs Notes:XXIllustrations have been moved to paragraph breaks near where they areXmentioned, except for the frontispiece.XXPunctuation has been made consistent.XXVariations in spelling and hyphenation were retained as they appear inXthe original publication, except that obvious typographical errors haveXbeen corrected.XX*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SAFETY FIRST CLUB FIGHTSXFIRE ***XXUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions willXbe renamed.XXCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyrightXlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,Xso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in theXUnited States without permission and without paying copyrightXroyalties.
