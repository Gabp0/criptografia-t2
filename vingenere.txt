His intentions were ofithe best; his industry, as a rule, was proof against distractions.iThis day, though, there was something in the very air which seemed toiinterfere with his work.iiIt was a fine day, a beautiful day. The sun shone brightly; a pleasantibreeze was blowing; beyond the open windows of the big assembly hallion the third floor of the high school tree tops were swaying gently.iIn spite of his efforts SamA>Ws gaze strayed to them, and lingered onithem, to the sad neglect of the instructive remarks on the Englishiparagraph, offered by the text-book lying open on his desk. Topicisentences, somehow, had lost their hold; A>ZproofsA>[ no longer appealed toihis reason; conclusions didnA>Wt matter in the least. Sam felt the spelliof the spring in his blood, and, to do him justice, fought against itsiinfluence.iiAs a student, the boy had to earn what he gained. He didnA>Wt lack brainsiby any manner of means; and he stood well in his classes, but this wasithe result of application rather than of inspiration. He had come upito the hall for a study period because it was quieter than his A>ZhomeA>[iroom, where a recitation was in progress; and a score of other pupilsihad followed the same plan. They were rather widely scattered in theibig space of the hall, and the teacher who was charged with maintainingiorder had the easiest of tasks. Spring fever might not promoteiindustry, but likewise it did not encourage mischief.iiFrom the window SamA>Ws glance came back to his comrades of the studyihour. Nearly all were classmates of his--Juniors--but only twoiwere among his special chums. Over in a corner a slender boy withithick-lensed spectacles was deep in a calculation, being by longiodds the busiest person in the room. Sam, surveying him, chuckled.iWilly Reynolds, known to his friends as the A>ZSharkA>[ because of hisiextraordinary appetite for mathematics, cared very little what theiweather might be, or whether the season were winter, summer, springior autumn, so long as he was provided with an interesting problem. Atia little distance from the Shark A>ZTrojanA>[ Walker was dallying withian English exercise. Sam grinned sympathetically, while he watchedithe slow motion of the TrojanA>Ws pencil; he knew just how his friendiwas longing to be out-of-doors and making holiday. Trojan was a goodifellow, rather a quiet chap, neither a dullard nor brilliant at hisibooks; likable, dependable, and a valued member of the little coterie,iof which Sam was the acknowledged leader.iiSamA>Ws smile faded as his glance passed from Walker to a brace of hisineighbors. He was not fond of Jack Hagle, and he disliked Edward Zorn.iIn the case of the former he might have found it hard to put the reasonifor his opinion into words. Hagle never had harmed him; at times heihad tried to be friendly; but there was something in JackA>Ws personalityiwhich didnA>Wt appeal to Sam. A>ZHagle puts a fellowA>Ws teeth on edge,isomehowA>[--so Sam had said more than once, and it would have puzzledihim to make the explanation more definite. As for Zorn--well, he was aischemer, an intriguer, a school and class politician, always workingifor this, that, or the other thing; now fawning, now blustering, butialways keeping the personal fortunes of Edward Zorn in mind. Once oritwice Sam and his chums had clashed with Zorn and his allies, and theiencounters had not left the feeling of respect one sometimes finds foria stout and honest adversary.iiSam turned again to consideration of the English paragraph. He tried toiconcentrate his attention upon the printed page before him, and so wasinot aware that the principal and the sub-master had entered the halliand were talking earnestly with the teacher on duty. The conference atithe desk went on for several minutes. The sub-master appeared to beiexcited. His voice rose a trifle, and Sam looked up. By this time allithe pupils were eyeing the group on the platform with varying degreesiof interest.iiSuddenly the sub-master turned to his chief and put a question. Whatiit was nobody in the body of the hall heard, but everybody saw theiprincipal nod agreement. To Sam at least the agreement did not seem toibe at all eager.iiA>ZWalker!A>[ the sub-master called out sharply.iiThe Trojan gave a start of surprise at the summons; rose; went forward.iThe principal put a query, his tone so low that the words wereiinaudible a dozen feet from the platform.iiA>ZWhy--why, I donA>Wt know, sir.A>[iiSam, straining his ears, barely caught the TrojanA>Ws answer. He quiteimissed both the next question and the reply. Then the sub-master put inia suggestion:iiA>ZSuppose we excuse Walker for a moment. We can--er--er--we can recallihim later.A>[iiAgain the principal nodded. Sam, closely attentive, was more stronglyiimpressed than before that the head of the school was not enjoying theimoment.iiThe Trojan walked back to his desk. His expression was puzzled. SamA>Wsiguess was that he was racking his memory and failing to recallidistinctly something about which he ought not to have been uncertain.iiA>ZHagle!A>[ said the sub-master.iiJack shuffled up the aisle and took his stand before the teachers. Hisiexamination was longer than the TrojanA>Ws, but the other pupils heardinot a word of it. Then Zorn was called, and again there was an exchangeialmost in whispers.iiThe sub-master consulted a list of names written on a card.iiA>ZParker!A>[ he said, after a momentA>Ws reflection.iiSam made his way to the platform. By this time his curiosity was keenienough. Zorn, he noticed, had not gone back to his former seat, butihad taken a place well forward, where he hardly could escape hearingiwhatever might be said.iiA>ZThatA>Ws a cheeky performance!A>[ Sam told himself--and then forgot Zornifor the moment; for the sub-master was addressing him.iiA>ZParker, perhaps you can help us. There is a point we wish toiestablish. In a case of--er--er--in a case of disputed ownership of aibook, let us say, suppose Walker claimed it----A>[iiA>ZThen IA>Wd say it was the TrojanA>Ws--I mean, WalkerA>Ws,A>[ Sam declarediwithout hesitation.iiA>ZThat is because you are a great friend of his?A>[iiA>ZItA>Ws because Trojan always tells the truth, sir.A>[iiA>ZI see. You give him a general vote of confidence?A>[iiA>ZYes, sir.A>[iiSam fancied that the principal moved uneasily, as if he didnA>Wt like theicourse the examination was taking. Yet the head of the school permittedihis assistant to go on.iiA>ZWell, Parker, it happens that the ownership of a certain book isia matter of some interest to us. We are anxious to establish itidefinitely. By the wayA>[--the sub-master pushed aside a paper on theidesk and revealed a worn and battered text-book it had concealed--A>Zbyithe way, can you tell us anything about this?A>[iiSam picked up the book. He glanced at the fly-leaves. They were torniand dog-eared, and bore a dozen scribbled entries. It was plain enoughithat the book had been handed down from class to class, though it wouldihave puzzled anybody to get much clew to its present ownership fromithe conflicting scrawls. Then Sam turned to the last printed page, andifound there a penciled skull and crossbones.iiA>ZIf Trojan says this is his Cicero, heA>Ws right, sir.A>[iiA>ZYou--er--er--you corroborate him, then?A>[iiAgain Sam sensed the principalA>Ws lack of approval of the question; butimade mental note, too, that he let the sub-master continue.iiA>ZYes, sir,A>[ said the boy; A>Zthough he doesnA>Wt need corroboration.A>[iiA>ZYouA>Wre absolutely sure?A>[iiA>ZI ought to be--I drew that picture on the last page. Did it one dayiwhen IA>Wd borrowed the book from Trojan.A>[iiA>ZLong ago?A>[iiA>ZTwo or three months.A>[iiThe sub-master frowned. A>ZThat is somewhat remote, Parker. If you haveia weakness for decorative effects, there has been time since thenifor you to adorn other texts. And if you havenA>Wt seen this book inimonths----A>[iiA>ZBut I have seen it, sir!A>[ Sam broke in. A>ZWhen? Last Friday. Justibefore our class went in for its Latin test I borrowed the book fromiTrojan to look up a passage. It--itA>Ws pretty freely marked with notesion hard places, you know.A>[iiA>ZSo I perceive,A>[ said the sub-master drily.iiSam coughed. A>ZAhem, ahem! Well, the fellows whoA>Wve had it have writteniin a lot of things, sir. And--and they help, when youA>Wre in a hurry.iAnd there was one A>VstickerA>W I _did_ want to get straight before weitackled the examination.A>[iiA>ZVery much of an eleventh-hour performance, wasnA>Wt it?A>[iiA>ZYes, sir. We were in the corridor--just before we went in.A>[iiA>ZAnd you are sure you returned the book?A>[iiA>ZPerfectly sure, sir. Trojan wanted it back--he had something to lookiup, too.A>[iiA>ZAnd you gave it to him?A>[iiSam smiled faintly. A>ZA>VGaveA>W is hardly the word, sir--he grabbed it.A>[iiA>ZThat was the last you saw of the book--in WalkerA>Ws hands, in theicorridor, outside the examination room?A>[iiA>ZRight there, sir.A>[iiA>ZBut you had your own Cicero with you?A>[iiA>ZI guess all the fellows had theirs. But we left them in theicorridor--thatA>Ws the way we always do, you know.A>[iiThe sub-master turned to the principal. A>ZWell, some things seem to beiestablished,A>[ he said. A>ZDo you care to take the witness?A>[iiThe principal seemed to hesitate. A>ZNo, Mr. Bacon,A>[ he said at last.iA>ZYouA>Wre quite right--some things we can now accept as established.A>[iiSam might have considered himself dismissed, but he lingered.iiA>ZIf thereA>Ws anything else I can tell you----A>[ he began; but theisub-master shook his head.iiA>ZNo; thatA>Wll do for you, Parker,A>[ he said curtly.iiSam, still very much in the fog of uncertainty and wondering greatlyithat there should be any doubt of the TrojanA>Ws claim to his book,iturned away from the platform. As he did so, he caught ZornA>Ws eye, andiwas reminded that that youth must have overheard all he had said.iWell, he didnA>Wt care; it was all true--so Sam told himself, even asia sense of resentment filled him. It wasnA>Wt ZornA>Ws affair; playingieavesdropper was a contemptible trick. Sam amended his statement toihimself: he did care; he objected strongly to ZornA>Ws action. At theifirst opportunity he would say so, forcefully and as publicly asimight be. He glared at the other, who, truth to relate, returned theiattention in kind. Then, Sam had passed by and was taking his seat atithe back of the hall.iiThe Trojan appeared to be in a brown study. His brow was furrowed, andihe was gazing at the wall in the fixed fashion which suggests seeingivery little. Jack Hagle had developed sudden absorption in his work,iand was bent over the text-book on his desk. The Shark was still deepiin his calculation. Nobody else in the room, though, was ignoring, oripretending to ignore, the peculiar affair which had interrupted theistudy period.iiThe instructors had their heads together in a consultation whichicontinued for several minutes. Then the principal and sub-master rose,iand walked to the door; halted; exchanged a word or two.iiA>ZWalker!A>[ the sub-master called, and the Trojan, his manner ofiperplexity remaining, again went forward. This time he did not returnito his seat, but followed the two men into the corridor.iiThe pupils left in the hall exchanged questioning glances. Every boyithere--with the exception of the Shark--felt that something out of theiusual run was happening; and most of the number, including Sam Parker,igroped vainly for the secret. Sam had a notion that Zorn, and perhapsiHagle, had clew to the mystery, and it is to be confessed that theisuspicion annoyed him. Therefore he awaited eagerly the reappearance ofithe Trojan.iiBut Trojan Walker did not come back to the hall.iiA gong clanged, marking the end of the period. Sam and the othersigathered up their books, and streamed out into the corridor, thereidividing and going on to their own rooms. In each of these there wasithe stir of preparation for home-going, for the period closed the dayA>Wsiwork; then came the little pause, while the rows of boys and girls satiquietly, awaiting the dismissal signal. Sam noted that Trojan was notiin his accustomed place; but hardly had he made sure of this when theigong clanged again, and the school session was over.iiSam marched out with his classmates, but lingered in the yard. So, asiit chanced, did a dozen other boys, among them several of his specialichums. There was the Shark, blinking behind his big spectacles. Thereiwas A>ZStepA>[ Jones, so called because in height, and thinness, andiangularity he suggested a stepladder. There was A>ZPokeA>[ Green, who wasiso plump that a finger could be poked into him anywhere. There was TomiOrkney, sturdy, reserved, not an ingratiating fellow but sound to theicore on better acquaintance. And, finally, there was Herman Boyd, longia member of the clan and possibly the TrojanA>Ws most intimate friend.iThese boys grouped themselves about Sam as about a leader, and waited,ias he waited, for the coming of Trojan Walker.iiA>ZSomething queer is on,A>[ Sam told them. A>ZI donA>Wt know what it is, butiIA>Wm going to find out. All I know so far is this.A>[ And he sketchedirapidly the incidents of the mastersA>W visit to the hall.iiThere was a murmur of surprise, followed by many questions. Sam shookihis head.iiA>ZSomehow TrojanA>Ws Cicero is mixed up in it--how, I canA>Wt guess,A>[ saidihe. A>ZI knew the book as soon as I saw it. Every one of the crowd wouldiknow it on sight.A>[iiA>ZThatA>Ws right,A>[ Step agreed. A>ZIA>Wve borrowed it a hundred times--got theibest lot of written-in notes that ever happened--regular life saverisometimes. Yes, IA>Wd know that bully old book as far as I could see it.A>[iiA>ZSame here!A>[ said Poke Green; then turned to the Shark.iiA>ZLook here, old polyhedron, you were in the hall--whatA>Ws your theory?iWhatA>Ws all the row about?A>[iiA>ZNo theory,A>[ said the Shark calmly. A>ZWasnA>Wt noticing--had somethingibetter to do.A>[iiA>ZWhat?A>[iiThe Shark shrugged. A>ZI could tell you in thirty seconds, but youicouldnA>Wt understand in thirty years.A>[iiA>ZI believe you!A>[ chuckled Poke cheerfully.iiZorn, who had drawn near the group, laughed cynically.iiA>ZHo, ho! If IA>Wm not mistaken, you fellows will hear something prettyisoon that you canA>Wt help understanding in three seconds instead ofithirty. And you wonA>Wt like it, at that!A>[iiThe friends stared at him; finally Step spoke:iiA>ZWhat is it weA>Wre not going to like?A>[iiA>ZWait and see.A>[iiA>ZRats!A>[ said Step scornfully.iiZorn scowled. A>ZYour gang has been putting on a lot of side lately, butiyou wonA>Wt feel so high and mighty after this.A>[iiA>ZHow do you know we wonA>Wt?A>[ It was the Shark who put the query, though,ias a rule, he took small part in such verbal clashes.iiA>ZHow--how do I know?A>[ Zorn appeared to be staggered by the demand.iSuddenly, however, his expression changed, and he pointed to a figureiframed by the arch of the great doorway.iiA>ZThere he is! Let him do the talking for a while.A>[iiThe Trojan slowly descended the steps. His face was pale; he movediheavily.iiSam met him and caught his arm.iiA>ZWhatA>Ws the row?A>[ he asked eagerly.iiThe Trojan hesitated. A>ZI--I--thereA>Ws a mistake, a mix-up, somehow.iItA>Ws over my Cicero. They--somebody, that is--found it in the desk Iisat at when we had the test the other day. Or they say that was whereithey found it. And the way the thing worked out--that was the worstiof it--made me look as if I were lying about it. They began by askingiwhere my Cicero was, and I said I supposed it was with the rest of myibooks. I thought it was; I hadnA>Wt missed it--you know weA>Wve had noiLatin recitation since the test. Then they sent me back to my seat,iand--andA>[--he hesitated again, glancing almost apologetically atiSam--A>Zand when they afterward took me to the principalA>Ws office, theyisaid they had evidence identifying the book as mine. They hadnA>Wt showniit to me before then. If they had, IA>Wd have claimed it, of course, noimatter how they happened to get hold of it. But the way everythingihappened, you see, seemed to make it a pretty black case againstime--lugging a text-book into an examination, and then trying to lieiout of it, and----A>[iiStep broke in hotly. A>ZYou say somebody identified the book as yours?iWho was mean enough to do that?A>[iiOnce more Zorn laughed, and it was a taunting laugh. A>ZHo, ho! DonA>Wt askiWalker that! Get it first-hand!A>[iiTom OrkneyA>Ws hand fell on his shoulder, and Tom spoke sternly:iiA>ZYouA>Wre aching to make trouble, somehow--anybody can see that. Cut itiout! This isnA>Wt your row, unless youA>Wre the telltale--understand?A>[iiZorn wriggled free. He retreated a pace or two; for OrkneyA>Ws hand hadibeen heavy.iiA>ZYouA>Wre a nice crowd!A>[ he sneered. A>ZThey say you call yourselves theiSafety First Club. Good name, that! Sure it is! Just fits in with theispeed Sam Parker made in saving himself and giving Walker away. SafetyiFirst! You bet thatA>Ws the rule with every one of you, and the rest canigo hang, for all you care!A>[iiOrkney would have charged the enemy, but Sam held him back. The lastiminute or two had been a trying time for Parker, as any time must beiwhich brings revelation that one has fallen into a most embarrassingipredicament. Sam had had his flash of illumination. He saw, allitoo distinctly, the complications in which he had become involved.iInnocently enough he had fallen into the r"rle of chief witness againstihis friend and club-mate. And Zorn had not played eavesdropper withoutiresult. That the knowledge thus gained would be used for the annoyanceiand discomfiture of the clan, Sam had no doubt; but he realized that aifight then and there would in no wise mend matters.iiA>ZEasy there, Tom, easy!A>[ he counseled. A>ZWe wonA>Wt have any scrappingijust now.A>[iiOrkney yielded, reluctantly.iiA>ZMight as well let me polish him off,A>[ he grumbled. A>ZItA>Wll have to beidone sooner or later.A>[iiA>ZVery likely--but better not now,A>[ said Sam quietly.iiA>ZSure! Always Safety First!A>[ jeered Zorn; and walked away, grinningiwryly.iiiiiCHAPTER II THE SAFETY FIRST CLUBiiiThe Safety First Club, to which Zorn had alluded so cynically, bore itsiname for what its members regarded as good and sufficient reasons.iiThe club had come into existence in the most natural fashioniimaginable. That is, a little group of boys who liked one anotherihad gathered about Sam Parker, had reached a simple but effectiveiorganization, and had been permitted to take possession of an unusedistable on the premises of Step JonesA>Ws father. This they had fittediup as headquarters, furnishing the place as best they might. Thenihad happened a series of incidents, of adventures and misadventures,iwhich had served to impress upon the chums the penalties life exactsifor heedlessness and carelessness. They had woefully misjudged TomiOrkney, for example--Tom, it may be explained, was not of the originaliband--and before they came to understanding of the sterling qualitiesiwhich eventually won him an election to the club, they had undergoneiexperiences well calculated to drive home the lesson of the danger inioverhasty thought or action.iiNow, it is not to be understood that old heads had been put upon youngishoulders. The boys still conducted themselves as healthy, active,iwell meaning but fallible lads of seventeen or thereabouts, and not asiworld-worn philosophers of seventy-one. They made mistakes--lots ofimistakes. They formed their judgments not on great knowledge but onisuch knowledge as they had--and when a blunder was made, they tried notito repeat it. And they strove to play the game fairly. Doubtless youiknow a dozen boys like these, and fancy them not the less because youifind them very human.iiSam Parker had put into effect the guiding rule of the club in avertingihostilities between Orkney and Edward Zorn, but he had by no meansiavoided the complications growing out of the affair of Trojan WalkerA>WsiCicero.iiThe Trojan himself was in serious trouble. Sentence had not yet beenipassed in his case, but apparently he stood convicted of violating theirule against taking text-books into rooms where examinations were held,iand of committing the still graver offense of A>Ztrying to lie out ofiit,A>[ as the school phrase ran.iiSam seemed to be likely to fall heir to the unhappy reputation ofibeing the chief witness against his friend. The story spread rapidly.iHe could observe its effects when he went to school the next morning.iA group of girls fell to whispering as he approached them, and drewiaside as he passed; some of the boys nodded stiffly. There was a loudicontroversy in a corner of the yard, which quieted of a sudden, when heicame near. Step, very red of face, said something in a low tone to theiyouth with whom he had been disputing, and joined Sam, slipping an armithrough his and drawing him away.iiA>ZConfound a chump, anyway!A>[ he growled. A>ZBut I say, Sam! Got anythingion for this afternoon? LetA>Ws take a hike somewhere.A>[iiSam suffered himself to be led out of earshot of the others. Then heispoke crisply:iiA>ZWhatA>Ws the row? Talking about me, are they?A>[iiStep tried to avoid the question.iiA>ZThere are a lot of idiots in this school. They run away with any fooliyarn, or let it run away with them, and----A>[iiA>ZAnd the yarn this time is about me--about Trojan and me, that is?A>[iiA>ZWhy--why, Sam----A>[iiA>ZYes or no, Step?A>[iiA>ZWell, yes; if you must have it. But I tell you, I put a flea in thatifellowA>Ws ear.A>[iiSam shook his head doubtfully. He was reminded, quaintly, that a fleaiwas a creature of remarkable agility, and he could not but suspect thatithis flea supplied by the impulsive Step might hop about very busily inithe next few days.iiA>ZI guess it would be better not to do much talking for a while,A>[ heisaid soberly.iiA>ZWhat! YouA>Wd let all the yapping go on, and say nothing?A>[iiA>ZIA>Wd say as little as I could.A>[iiStep stared at Sam. A>ZGreat Scott! If we donA>Wt deny it, everybody willibelieve itA>Ws all so!A>[iiA>ZWell, deny it, then, and stop there.A>[iiStep whistled softly. A>ZWhe-e-e! Sam, I reckon you donA>Wt know all theitrimmings the story is getting. ItA>Ws an awful thing for you and for theiwhole club.A>[iiA>ZI see that,A>[ said Sam. A>ZWhat hits any one of a crowd like ours hitsithe whole bunch. ThatA>Ws the worst of it.A>[iiA>ZBut canA>Wt we do anything?A>[ Step demanded impatiently.iiSamA>Ws eyes flashed. There were several things he would have been veryiglad to do--violent things, some of them. But in the last few months heihad learned steadying lessons in the value of self-control. Perhaps itiwas because he had learned these lessons more thoroughly than had anyiof his mates that he remained the guiding spirit of the club.iiA>ZThe first thing to do is to keep our heads. The next is to wait to seeijust what happens.... Hold on there, Step! DonA>Wt think IA>Wm for lyingidown and letting everybody trample on us! IA>Wll fight, and try to fightias hard as any of the rest of you--when the time comes. But I think itihasnA>Wt come yet.A>[iiStep shrugged his shoulders. A>ZWell, if thatA>Ws your notion, all right.iI donA>Wt believe thereA>Ws another fellow in Plainfield who could put itithrough, but maybe you can.A>[iiA>ZWait and see,A>[ said Sam very gravely.iiThe morning session gave plenty of evidence of the spread of the storyithrough the Junior class, and, indeed, through the school. Sam wasiperfectly conscious of a cooling in the regard in which he was held. Atirecess the club rallied about him, but other classmates shunned him. Itiwas at recess, too, that the Trojan heard his fate. He came out of theiprincipalA>Ws office, after a five-minute conference, looking as dejectedias a boy in physical health could look.iiA>ZI get zero on the Latin paper--a clean flunk--to begin with,A>[ heireported. A>ZThatA>Ws on a charge of taking a book into the examination.iThen IA>Wm laid off, as far as Cicero goes, for the rest of the term.iThat is on the charge that I tried to squirrel out of the fix and liediabout the book.A>[iiA>ZBut thatA>Ws a half suspension!A>[iiA>ZHowA>Wll you keep up?A>[iiA>ZWhere does it leave your standing now?A>[iiA>ZWouldnA>Wt they give you a chance to defend yourself?A>[iiThere was a medley of exclamations and questions. The Trojan madeianswer in general:iiA>ZI donA>Wt know just how it will work out. I donA>Wt know what IA>Wm going toido.A>[iiA>ZBut you canA>Wt drop out!A>[ cried Step hotly.iiThe Trojan smiled, but the smile had no mirth in it.iiA>ZYou canA>Wt tell what you can do, Step, till you try,A>[ he said.iiA>ZBut it would break up the crowd--the club! WeA>Wve been together, andiweA>Wve stuck together since I donA>Wt remember when. And weA>Wve been in theisame class, and weA>Wve all kept traveling along together through schooliand----A>[iiA>ZI know all that,A>[ the Trojan interrupted.iiThe Shark was moved to speech. A>ZLook here, Trojan! Tell me something.iThey say they found your Cicero where it had no business to be--whoifound it?A>[iiA>ZOne of the Freshmen, I think.A>[iiA>ZWhich one?A>[iiA>ZI donA>Wt know.A>[iiThe Shark snorted. A>ZHuh! Find out!A>[iiA>ZWhat difference does it make?A>[ asked the Trojan dully.iiA>ZAll the difference!A>[ snapped the Shark. A>ZProblem, isnA>Wt it? Course itiis! How you going to solve it till you have facts to work on?A>[iiA>ZI meant that so long as the book was found in a desk in theiexamination room, it didnA>Wt matter who found it. The Freshman, whoeveriit was, gave it to the teacher in charge there.A>[iiA>ZKid trick!A>[ Step put in.iiA>ZOh, a yearling wouldnA>Wt know any better,A>[ said Herman Boyd. A>ZHeiwouldnA>Wt intend any harm.A>[iiA>ZWell, now, you canA>Wt be too sure----A>[ Poke began; but the Sharkibrought the talk back to the main question.iiA>ZHow do you know, Trojan, it was found in the desk you used that day?A>[iiA>ZHow? Why--why, I suppose it must have been.A>[iiA>ZSuppose!A>[ groaned the Shark. A>ZCanA>Wt you fellows ever learn to beiexact?A>[iiA little color came into the TrojanA>Ws cheeks at the thrust. A>ZBeireasonable, Shark! If a brick fell from a chimney and hit you, wouldiyou--er--er--would you find out, first thing, how tall the chimney was?iThis--this whole business--well, it just took me off my feet.A>[iiA>ZHuh! Guess it did. But IA>Wve got my feet under me, and IA>Wd like to getithings straight. Now, tell me! WhatA>Ws the last--the last thing youA>Wreiabsolutely sure about--about the book, I mean?A>[iiA>ZI left it in the corridor. Sam had borrowed it for a minute, butihe gave it back. I had just time to look up a passage before theibell rang. Then I left the Cicero with two or three other books Iihad--stacked A>Wem against the wall, just as all the other fellows didiwith theirs. When we came out, after the examination, everybody was inia rush to get away. I grabbed up my books. I didnA>Wt stop to count A>Wem.iI took it for granted all of them were there. And as weA>Wve had no Latinirecitation since then, it didnA>Wt occur to me to look up my Cicero.A>[iiA>ZSame case here--same to a dot!A>[ testified Poke.iiA>ZNothing to do with the case,A>[ objected the Shark. A>ZWeA>Wre figuring onithe TrojanA>Ws row. And where did you sit, Trojan?A>[iiA>ZIn the back row.A>[iiA>ZSure of that?A>[iiA>ZYes.A>[iiA>ZI remember he was there,A>[ Sam corroborated. A>ZI was two rows in frontiof him.A>[iiA>ZWhich desk did you have, Trojan?A>[ the Shark persisted.iiA>ZWhich? Why--why, one near the middle of the row.A>[iiA>ZAble to point it out surely?A>[iiThe Trojan hesitated. A>ZI--I guess so. Only I didnA>Wt notice especially.A>[iiA>ZUmph! Remember your neighbors?A>[iiThe Trojan wrinkled his brow. A>ZLetA>Ws see! None of our crowd was veryinear me.A>[iiA>ZWas Zorn?A>[ Sam queried.iiA>ZI think he was over to the left--two or three desks away.A>[iiA>ZAnd Jack Hagle?A>[iiA>ZYes, he was near me.A>[iiA>ZHow near?A>[ the Shark demanded.iiThe Trojan shook his head. A>ZI canA>Wt tell you that. Confound it! youifellows seem to forget that I was trying to pass a Latin paper and notimapping the room. I remember Hagle was somewhere around, and Zorn wasinot very far off. Yes, and Sam was a couple of rows in front of me. Butithat is all I can recall of what didnA>Wt impress me especially at theitime.A>[iiA>ZUmph!A>[ said the Shark, and made no further inquiry.iiHere the big gong clanged, and the pupils streamed back into theischoolhouse, the Safety First Club members going with the others. Samifelt a certain relief as he saw the Trojan taking his place in line:ihe had had disquieting doubts about the course Walker might follow. Aifellow smarting under a sense of injustice--SamA>Ws confidence in theiTrojanA>Ws honesty was unshaken--might do something in haste which wouldilead to deep repentance at leisure. But the Trojan went back to theiclassroom, and joined in the recitation almost in his usual manner. Asiit happened, the Latin hour had passed, so that the partial suspensionidid not interfere with the work he had to do after recess.iiBeing far from blind, and, in fact, being especially keenly observantithat day, Sam gathered more evidence of the spread of the story ofithe TrojanA>Ws trouble and his own share in bringing it about. Now andithen he met glances which were frankly unfriendly: when the divisionsichanged rooms between periods he made note that some of the girls,ipassing him in the corridors, took pains to keep as far from him asipossible. It was not a pleasant experience for the boy; but for theipresent, at least, there was nothing he could do but grit his teeth andikeep his temper.iiSamA>Ws lessons in self-discipline stood him in good stead. They helpedihim study his problem, while he resisted temptation to rage against hisifate.iiEd Zorn must have been extremely busy in circulating his version ofiwhat had occurred in the hall.iiThat was, to SamA>Ws mind, a big, outstanding fact. Only Zorn had beeninear enough to overhear his testimony. The principal and the sub-masteriwould not have spread the story; therefore, ZornA>Ws responsibility wasihardly matter for argument.iiWhy, though, should he have displayed such zeal in making the affairipublic property?iiSam shook his head over this question. Zorn was no friend of theiSafety First Club; but something more than mere lack of liking wasineeded fully to explain his conduct. It was still a puzzle to Sam, whenithe session came to an end, and school was dismissed for the day.iiWhen the Trojan came down the steps, Sam was waiting for him. Theyiwalked away together, both keeping silence until they had left theiyard. Then, as they turned into a quiet side street, Sam spoke.iiA>ZTrojan, thereA>Ws just one thing I want you to understand. If IA>Wdidreamed I was getting you into this fix, they couldnA>Wt have pried aiword out of me.A>[iiA>ZI know that, Sam,A>[ said the other, evenly.iiA>ZBut I did get you into it. Somehow, the way things happened, IicouldnA>Wt have done more harm if IA>Wd schemed a week! That part of itA>Wsiup to me, all right!A>[iiThe Trojan kept his eyes straight before him. A>ZOh, IA>Wm not blamingiyou,A>[ he said. A>ZWhatA>Wd be the use? WhatA>Ws the use now of--of anything?A>[iiA>ZHere, drop that talk!A>[ Sam counseled. A>ZKeep a stiff upper lip! See youidonA>Wt get rattled!A>[iiThe Trojan stopped short. He turned to his comrade.iiA>ZRattled!A>[ he cried. A>ZSam, you know what theyA>Wve done to me? It isipractically throwing me out of the class! My term marks in Latin areismashed. Pretty chance IA>Wd have to keep up the work outside, even ifitheyA>Wd let me take the final examination! And a clean flunk in Latiniwould put me down and out. IA>Wd better quit altogether. IA>Wve beenithinking it over. I donA>Wt see anything else to do.A>[iiA>ZItA>Ws the one thing you canA>Wt do--you shanA>Wt do!A>[ Sam protested.iiThe TrojanA>Ws manner changed; he spoke dully but with a sort ofidetermination.iiA>ZIA>Wve thought it out, I say. You know my case--the case at home, Iimean.A>[iiSam nodded. TrojanA>Ws father, a traveling salesman, was away on a longitrip through the West; his mother was a semi-invalid, quite incapableiof coming to her sonA>Ws assistance in an emergency like this.iiA>ZDropping outA>Wd be the simplest and the best,A>[ Walker went on. A>ZI guessithere are other schools--if there arenA>Wt any to take me, I can go toiwork somewhere.A>[iiA>ZNonsense! You stay here!A>[iiA>ZI wonA>Wt. This is my own affair--IA>Wve got to settle it for myself.A>[iThen his voice rose. A>ZSam, they didnA>Wt give me a square deal! It wasnA>Wtifair! They trapped me; they caught me by a trick! I wonA>Wt stand it! IA>Wmithrough with them--I want to be through with anybody thatA>Wll treat meias IA>Wve been treated!A>[iiSam stared at him in perplexity. The old Trojan had been easy going,igood natured, a fellow who preferred compromise; the new Trojan wasicuriously grim and determined and unyielding. There was a glint in hisieye Sam had never seen there before; his jaw was set stubbornly. TheiTrojan was in earnest, in deadly earnest. Sam realized this, and hisiheart sank within him. Nevertheless, he was ready to fight manfully.iiA>ZYouA>Wre all wrong! It wasnA>Wt a square deal--IA>Wm with you there. But IA>Wminot sure that wasnA>Wt accidental--the way it happened, I mean. ThereA>Wsisomething else, though--you canA>Wt go ahead as if nobody but yourselfiwas hit.A>[iiA>ZOh! CanA>Wt I?A>[ growled the Trojan.iiA>ZYou canA>Wt, because weA>Wre all in the row. IA>Wm in up to my neck; thereiisnA>Wt a fellow in the club who doesnA>Wt feel that itA>Ws his fight as wellias yours and mine.A>[iiA>ZItA>Ws all right to say that, only you canA>Wt prove it.A>[iiA>ZWhy--why----A>[ Sam began; but he was to be spared the need of makingihis argument.iiAround the corner, from the direction of the school, came Poke, walkingifast and dabbing at his face with a handkerchief. At sight of theiothers he pulled up; gave a gasp; betrayed symptoms of a desire to turniand retreat; hesitated; reached decision; strode forward, grinningimost unconvincingly. Beneath one of his eyes the flesh was bruised andireddened.iiA>ZWhatA>Ws the matter?A>[ Sam demanded sharply.iiThe grin on PokeA>Ws usually placid countenance was maintained by patentieffort.iiA>ZOh, nothing! Just a--no; nothingA>Ws the matter.A>[iiA>ZWho blacked your eye?A>[iiA>ZA>WTisnA>Wt blacked.A>[iiA>ZItA>Wll be black enough in an hour or two. Who smashed you?A>[iiPokeA>Ws glance went from Sam to the Trojan, but returned swiftly, and aibit appealingly, to the chief of the Safety First Club.iiA>ZItA>Ws nothing, I tell you. CanA>Wt a fellow do anything without youriholding him up?A>[iiA>ZThat depends. When it comes to getting black eyes----A>[iiA>ZOh, that was just a--a bump that came my way,A>[ Poke put in hastily.iA>ZNot worth mentioning. And say! IA>Wm in a hurry, Sam. CanA>Wt stop to talkito you fellows. A>WBy!A>[iiSo speaking, Poke stepped by his friends, taking care to keep out ofiarmA>Ws reach, and hurried along the street.iiThe others did not pursue him. Sam looked at the Trojan, and the Trojanimet his gaze unhappily.iiA>ZYou know what that means?A>[ Sam asked with a touch of sternness.iiThe Trojan nodded. Poke Green, most peaceful of mortals, had been in aifight; moreover, it was to be suspected that Poke neither had shunnedinor now repented the combat.iiSam pressed his advantage. A>ZIt means that what I told you is true: thatithis thing brings in every fellow in the club. WeA>Wre standing together;ithe crowd is backing you, and itA>Wll back me, for IA>Wm going to needifriends as you need A>Wem. We canA>Wt quit cold, either of us. WeA>Wve got toiplay the game through, clear up this mess, and win out!A>[iiA>ZHow can we win?A>[iiA>ZI donA>Wt know yet, but we will win, if it takes all summer.A>[iiA>ZI donA>Wt see whatA>Ws to be done.A>[iiA>ZGive me time--give the club time, that is.A>[iiThere was a little pause. Then said the Trojan, dejectedly:iiA>ZItA>Wll be no use. Still, if youA>Wre so set about it, Sam--and I supposeiitA>Ws only right to stand by the crowd, if itA>Ws standing by me. But whatido you want me to do?A>[iiA>ZPromise not to bolt till weA>Wve had a chance to catch our breath. Andipromise to let us know--give us fair warning--before you do anything.A>[iiThere was another pause.iiA>ZSam,A>[ said the Trojan at last, A>ZSam, I--I guess IA>Wll have to promiseiyou so much, anyway.A>[iiiiiCHAPTER III THE OPEN AIR TREATMENTiiiPlainfield High School, like most other schools, had its politics.iThere were, of course, the usual rivalries between the classes; thenithere were the likes and dislikes of various groups in each class;ithere was some sharp competition for honors in scholarship, and ratherimore for the prizes of personal popularity and leadership. In fact,ilife inside the school was a deal like life outside it, with theisame mingling of the ambitious and the indifferent, the industriousiand the idle, the prudent and the venturesome, the schemers and theihappy-go-lucky souls with never a thought for the morrow.iiTaken individually, the boys of the Safety First Club enjoyedipopularity above the average, but as a crowd, or a clique, or aniorganization--whichever you prefer to call it--they had many critics.iFrankly, envy had much to do with this state of things. Other A>ZgangsA>[icame together, and flourished for a time, and fell apart: the clubicontinued. Most boys are clannish by instinct, and here was a claniwhich truly was a standing challenge to less successful organizers.iMoreover, it did not try to enlarge its membership; and here again wasicause of grievance. There were a dozen juniors who would have prized aniinvitation to join the Safety Firsts above any reward in the gift ofithe school. There were several who had made eager overtures to Sam andihis allies without result; there were others who had sought entranceito the charmed circle by war, so to speak. Oddly enough, the only oneito succeed had been of these open enemies. In his day Tom Orkney hadiopposed the club bitterly, and so had borne his full share in bringingiabout complications, from which, as it chanced, nobody suffered soigrievously as Tom himself. But the experience had enabled the clubito put Orkney to the test. He had not been found wanting, and in theiend had gained his place in the clan by the very excellent process ofiearning it, which, after all, is perhaps the most satisfactory processiin the long run.iiSam Parker was under no illusions as to these conditions. He knew theispeed with which gossip spreads. He understood perfectly the causesiwhich would prejudice judgment of the trouble in which the Trojan wasiinvolved, and in which he himself shared, and from which the otherimembers of the club could not escape wholly. The club would standitogether; therefore all the club must feel the effects of the scandal.iAnd Sam, as the head of the club, must justify his leadership.iiA year earlier in such a case he might have consulted his father, butinow he was bent on working out his problem for himself. Self-relianceiwas a quality he was trying to develop, and Mr. Parker approvedithis policy. So Sam, parting at last from the Trojan, went home inithoughtful mood; found that he was late for dinner, and sat himselfidown at the table to dine alone under the critical eye of Maggie, theimaid, a very good friend of his, by the way, but by no means blinded byipartiality to his shortcomings.iiSam ate mechanically but with good appetite. He cleared his plate.iiA>ZWant some more meat?A>[ Maggie asked curtly.iiA>ZWhy--whyA>[--he was thinking of anything but his food--A>Zwhy--why, Iiguess--not. No, thank you.A>[iiMaggie sniffed skeptically. Moreover, she picked up his plate,idisappeared for a moment in the kitchen, returned with a secondigenerous portion.iiA>ZEat that--guess youA>Wll need it soon enough!A>[ she remarked.iiSam looked up. A>ZEr--er--what do you mean, Maggie?A>[iiA>ZYou donA>Wt need telling.... Take your time, though--donA>Wt gobble!A>[iiSam meekly obeyed. A>ZOh, all right. IA>Wve got lots of time. I--I mustihave been thinking about something else.A>[iiMaggieA>Ws lip curled. A>ZThat ainA>Wt what IA>Wd call a secret, exactly. Aiblind man could see you were wool-gathering.... What scrape you in now?A>[iiA>ZOh, noth--nothing in particular.A>[iiA>ZUmph! They never are, by your tell.A>[iiSam, failing to find satisfactory response, made none, and devoted hisiefforts to his knife and fork. Maggie set her arms akimbo, and surveyedihim grimly.iiA>ZWell, I must say thereA>Ws one comfort: you donA>Wt take out your spite oniyour victuals.... But how bad is it?A>[iiA>ZItA>Ws--er--er--itA>Ws no killing matter.A>[iiA>ZWhat are you worrying so for, then?A>[iiA>ZIA>Wm not worrying!A>[iiMaggie smiled oddly. A>ZWell, I do declare! Sam Parker, itA>Ws the firstitime I ever knew you to be practising to be a play actor!A>[iiSam wriggled. A>ZOh, quit your joshing! IA>Wm bothered about--aboutisomething. IA>Wve got to figure out what to do--thatA>Ws all.A>[iiA>ZWant any help?A>[iiA>ZNo--no, thank you.A>[iiA>ZUmph! Maybe youA>Wd like some pudding, then?A>[iiA>ZNo, thank you,A>[ Sam repeated, and pushed back his chair.iiA>ZBetter think twice about it,A>[ Maggie urged. A>ZItA>Wll be a long timeibefore supper.A>[iiSam snatched up his cap, and hurried out, calling back a third A>ZNo,ithank you,A>[ over his shoulder.iiThere was a big, old-fashioned barn on the Parker place, part of whichiwas now in use as a garage. Just outside its wide door stood a touringicar, the cover of its hood raised. A clean-shaven man in overalls, whoihad been pottering about the motor, caught sight of Sam, and hailed himicheerily:iiA>ZHi there! WhereA>Ws the fire?A>[iiSam pulled up. A>ZFire? What are you talking about, Lon? I havenA>Wt heardiany alarm.A>[iiLon Gates, man-of-all-work, coachman, gardener, chauffeur, and generalifactotum, chuckled. He studied Sam for a moment. They were greatifriends, were these two, and more than once the man had proved a toweriof strength for the boy in time of trouble.iiA>ZNo fire, eh? Thought you must be goinA>W to one, way you was speedinA>W.A>[iiA>ZWell, I wasnA>Wt.A>[iiA>ZSo?A>[ Lon appeared to reflect briefly. A>ZHuh! Then you must A>WaA>W beenilike a feller I seen goinA>W over a dam one freshet time--lots oA>W hurryiand no special intention.A>[iiA>ZWhat happened to him?A>[iiLon shook his head. A>ZDunno. Guess he got out of it all right, somehow.iTurns out that way now and then.A>[iiA>ZGlad to hear it,A>[ said Sam.iiAgain Lon surveyed his youthful friend. A>ZHuh! Something botherinA>W you,ieh?A>[iiA>ZYes--bothering me a lot.A>[iiThere was a pause. Lon, perceiving that Sam was not disposed to explainihis trouble, respected his reticence, and asked no questions.iiA>ZGuess, mebbe, I made a mistake to stop you,A>[ he remarked at last. A>ZOldiDr. Shanksmare cures a heap oA>W misery--him and his open air treatment.iFeelinA>W as you do, guess you might as well run along.A>[iiBut Sam, having been halted, seemed to be in no haste.iiA>ZHang it! thereA>Ws nowhere to go,A>[ he complained.iiA>ZWhatA>Ws the matter with goinA>W swimminA>W?A>[iiA>ZToo cold yet.A>[iiA>ZTry a hike, then.A>[iiA>ZToo hot.A>[iiLon laid down the wrench with which he had been working; he made quiteia ceremony of wiping his hands on a bunch of waste.iiA>ZSam, you kinder remind me oA>W the old lady with the plate oA>Wihalf-melted ice-cream--she said it was too soft to eat and too hardito drink. Yet it was pooty good ice-cream, at that; soA>Ws this a pootyigood spring day, if only youA>Wll take it right. And so longA>Ws youiainA>Wt feelinA>W moved to sob out the sorrows oA>W your young life on thisisympathizinA>W bosom, why donA>Wt you walk A>Wem off? Get your crowd. Goisomewhere.

A>ZThereA>Ws Crescent lake, for one thing.A>[iiA>ZCrescent lake?A>[iiA>ZYep. ThatA>Ws the new name. Used to be MudgettA>Ws pond. Then some oA>Withe folks got to readinA>W poetry, and tried to call it Half-Moon. NowithereA>Ws a syndicate openinA>W it up, puttinA>W in roads, and sellinA>W sitesifor cottages and camps.

A>ZGettinA>W too proud of your Latin to recognizeiyour old French friends when you meet A>Wem? Or mebbe youA>Wre used toicallinA>W that special old crony A>Vknee.A>WA>[iiSam laughed. A>ZIA>Wm afraid to say just what I might call it. But IididnA>Wt know, Lon, that you were such a linguist.A>[iiA>ZOh, IA>Wm like old Peter Hunker, buyinA>W a new slate for his boy. A>VGiveime the best ten-cent slate you got in the store,A>W says Peter to theiclerk. A>VI believe in a liberal eddication.A>W And thatA>Ws jest my case,iSam. And believinA>W in beinA>W liberal with it, I spend my French sameA>Wsimy English--get the idee?A>[iiA>ZYes,A>[ said Sam, A>ZI grasp it.A>[iiLon picked up his wrench, and began to busy himself with the motor.iiA>ZThink youA>Wll take a dose oA>W Dr. ShanksmareA>Ws medicine?A>[ he inquired.iiSam meditated briefly. A long walk with his chums would giveiopportunity to discuss the case of the Trojan, his own predicament,iand the plight of the club. And even a nominal purpose in a tramp wasibetter than aimless wandering. He felt no burning curiosity about theiimprovements at Crescent lake, but was willing enough to look themiover. Still, the lake was seven or eight miles from town. He mentionedithe circumstance, and Lon responded promptly:iiA>ZThatA>Ws all right--jest distance enough. And IA>Wll see that you donA>Wtihave to walk back. HowA>Ws that? Simple enough. IA>Wve got to take aipackage for your Ma out to MisA>W Haskins at the Ridge, and cominA>W back,iIA>Wll swing round by the foot oA>W the lake and pick you up.

IA>Wll telephone to the fellows, and ifitheyA>Wll join in, weA>Wll make the hike.A>[iiA>ZNow youA>Wre talkinA>W sense,A>[ quoth Lon heartily.iiA>ZOh, I guess the scheme is all right.A>[iiA>ZOf course it is,A>[ Lon encouraged. A>ZItA>Wll do you good to stretch yourilegs, and mebbe youA>Wll manage to do a stroke oA>W business, somehow. Youinever can tell, Sam, whatA>Ws waitinA>W for you round the next turn in theiroad.A>[iiA>ZI guess thatA>Ws so,A>[ Sam admitted.iiA>ZSure it is!A>[ said Lon with conviction. A>ZThatA>Ws what makes travelinA>Withe roads worth while, sonny!A>[iiiiiCHAPTER IV THE CLUB AT THE COUNCIL ROCKiiiOf the club there responded to SamA>Ws call Poke and Step, the Shark,iTom Orkney and Herman Boyd. The Trojan was not at home. On the whole,iSam did not regret the fact that Walker was not to be with them thatiafternoon: certain matters of common concern could be talked over moreifreely in his absence.iiPokeA>Ws marks of combat were not to be hidden. The bruised flesh beneathihis eye was beginning to show a prismatic variety of coloring, in spiteiof the application of several remedies in favor among the youth of theitown; but Sam did not fail to observe that the other boys were carefulito maintain an air of noticing nothing out of the common in PokeA>Wsiappearance. It was significant testimony to the serious view theyitook of the whole affair. Even a black eye was not matter for jest.iPresently, no doubt, Poke would tell the story; but until he choseito speak, his silence would be respected. Boys, as a rule, are noticredited with a high degree of consideration, but at times can displayia restraint which many of their elders would find it hard to equal.iiOn the march Sam managed to have a few confidential words with each ofihis companions, acquainting them with the TrojanA>Ws promise to take noihasty step. He was gratified to find in each case strong approval ofithis decision, and just as strong desire to do anything possible toiuphold the good name of the club and all its members.iiA>ZYou tell us whatA>Ws the program, Sam, and weA>Wll stand by youA>[--that wasithe way Orkney put it, and the speech fairly represented the spirit ofiall the party.iiA seven-mile tramp, of a fine day, is really play for healthyischoolboys. The club thought nothing of it. Sam felt his spiritsirising, and began to be glad that he had accepted LonA>Ws counsel. Heicould even join heartily in a discussion of short cuts, and finallyicarry the decision in favor of the one he approved, which followed aiwoods road, and then a mere path. The country about the lake was thinlyisettled, with many wooded tracts, a few swampy patches, and a numberiof low ridges, from the top of the last of which Step was the first toicatch sight of the shining blue of the water. The marchers streamedidown the slope, and out upon a little promontory, pleasantly shaded byibig trees and with a great rock almost at its tip.iiThere was a chorus of exclamations. A>ZBully place!A>[ A>ZSay, weA>Wve hit theireal beauty spot!A>[ A>ZWhat a camp site this would be, eh?A>[ A>ZHowA>Wd happeniwe never came here before? Looks like a crackerjack of a pond!A>[iiSam advanced to the waterA>Ws edge, and glanced up and down the lake.iA sound of hammering from the opposite shore helped him to discoverithe new pavilion, taking shape in a grove nearly half a mile away; heicould make out the lines of the framework and the half-hidden smalleribuildings, flanking it and already completed.iiA>ZGuess we missed the road,A>[ he said. A>ZOught to have taken that lastiturn to the right instead of the one to the left.A>[iiA>ZWhatA>Ws the difference?A>[ Step demanded. A>ZIA>Wll bet weA>Wve found theiprettiest place on the shore.A>[iiPoke had been exploring the outcropping ledge.iiA>ZLook here, you fellows!A>[ he shouted. A>ZSay, this is the finest oldicouncil rock you ever set eyes on!A>[iiThe others joined him. On its side toward the water the mass of stoneiwas hollowed out in a sort of half bowl or natural amphitheatre on aismall scale. There was room for a score of boys, and the irregularitiesiin the surface of the rock offered bench-like seats. Poke settledihimself with an air of triumph in spite of his battered appearance.iiA>ZSit down, everybody!A>[ he suggested. A>ZLetA>Ws be comfortable, and talk itiover.A>[iiOrkney glanced at PokeA>Ws discolored countenance.iiA>ZIf the time to talk has come, youA>Wd better begin,A>[ he said pointedly.iA>ZIA>Wd like to know just how you came by that shiner.A>[iiA>ZGuess, canA>Wt you?A>[ Poke queried.iiA>ZYes, but I want the facts.A>[iiThere was a murmur of agreement. A>ZGo to it!A>[ Step urged.iiA>ZWell, I met a fellow and he said something----A>[ Poke began.iiA>ZWho was he, and what did he say?A>[ Herman Boyd interposed.iiPoke hesitated, then reached decision. A>ZHe--it was A>VScrubA>W Payne. Heigot to roughing me about--well, about things--our putting on side butinot hanging together in a pinch--rot like that, you know!A>[iiA>ZJust what did he say?A>[ Sam asked sharply.iiPoke straightened his shoulders. A>ZWell--if you must have it--he saidithat the Trojan tried to lie out of taking a book into examination, andithat he might have got away with it, if Sam hadnA>Wt thrown him down.iThen I called him a liar, of course. And--and thatA>Ws about all.A>[iiThere was a very brief silence. Tom Orkney ended it.iiA>ZScrub Payne, eh?A>[ He repeated the name softly, lingeringly. A>ZScrubiPayne? Twice your height, almost--A>Wbout weigh in in my class,iPoke--yes, yes. And spreading that story, was he?A>[iiSam raised a hand. A>ZListen, Tom! Listen, all you fellows! We might asiwell understand that thatA>Ws the yarn the whole school has had. Andihammering up three or four who talk out loud wonA>Wt disprove it.... Waitia minute, Step! Let me finish. IA>Wve got a score or two to settle, butithis isnA>Wt the time to do it. ItA>Ws perfectly clear Ed Zorn is at theibottom of the trouble--heA>Ws the only one who heard what was said inithe hall.

HeA>Ws agreed not toimake a bolt without letting us know, but it seems to me itA>Ws up to usito fix things so heA>Wll be willing to stay.A>[iiA>ZSay, thatA>Ws going to be a contract!A>[ Step exclaimed.iiThe others nodded agreement.iiA>ZItA>Ws the Latin thatA>Ws the facer--outside of his feelings,A>[ saidiHerman Boyd gravely. A>ZHeA>Wll be flunked, if he canA>Wt go to recitations,iespecially with a zero mark for the test to pull down his term stand.A>[iiThe Shark was scowling behind his spectacles. A>ZLetA>Ws do some figuring,A>[ihe suggested. A>ZHow were his marks up to this mix-up?A>[iiA>ZOh, fair--along in the eighties,A>[ said Herman.iiA>ZWhat do you mean by A>ValongA>W?A>[iiA>ZCall it eighty-five or eighty-six.A>[iiA>ZHow much does a test count?A>[iiA>ZAbout the same as a weekA>Ws recitations,A>[ said Herman, but Step offerediA>ZTen daysA>[ almost simultaneously.iiThe SharkA>Ws scowl increased. A>ZThere you go! CanA>Wt you fellows beiprecise about anything? Which is it?A>[iiThe club tried to agree on the point, but failed.iiA>ZAnyway, the zero will pull him below seventy,A>[ Herman declared.iSeventy being the passing mark, the faces of two or three of the clubilengthened.iiA>ZThen if he has to stay away from recitations, heA>Wll have no chance toiincrease his mark,A>[ groaned Step.iiA>ZAnd what sort of a show will he have in the final examination?A>[ Pokeiput in.iiA>ZNo show at all!A>[ said the Shark promptly. A>ZUmph! No need to take toifiguring on that.A>[iiA>ZHold on, fellows!A>[ said Sam. A>ZI donA>Wt get light on the term-standipart of it, but on the other--the final, I mean--well, thereA>Ws a way.A>[iiA>ZWhat way?A>[ two or three demanded together.iiA>ZWe can work with him afternoons--tutor him--keep him up with theiclass.A>[iiA>ZGood scheme, Sam!A>[ shouted Step.iiA>ZFine! IA>Wm for it!A>[ added Herman.iiA>ZSame here!A>[ said Poke. A>ZIA>Wm no prodigy in Cicero, but IA>Wm good andiwilling.A>[iiThere was evident revival of spirit in the clan.iiA>ZIA>Wll try to class with Poke,A>[ Tom Orkney contributed gravely, butihopefully.iiBut the Shark was shaking his head dubiously. A>ZLetA>Ws get this thingistraight. We can tutor the Trojan--that is, you chaps can--I donA>Wt goimuch on this language foolishness myself. But if you do, will he beiallowed to take the final?A>[iiA>ZWhy shouldnA>Wt they let him?A>[ Step asked hotly.iiA>ZIA>Wm after facts, not reasons one way or the other. WhatA>Ws the fact?A>[iiA>ZBut theyA>Wll just have to!A>[iiA>ZWhatA>Ws the fact?A>[ the Shark repeated inexorably.iiA>ZI donA>Wt know,A>[ Sam confessed, as the others glanced at him inquiringly.iiA>ZThen youA>Wd better find out,A>[ said the Shark simply.iiA>ZHow?A>[iiA>ZFrom headquarters. Ask the principal.A>[iiA>ZOh!A>[ said Sam. His tone was not blithe.iiA>ZYouA>Wve struck the right track, Shark!A>[ Poke declared.iiA>ZNo; IA>Wm putting Sam on it,A>[ the Shark corrected.iiThere are obligations in leadership as well as privileges.

ButithereA>Ws another thing--we ought to agree--have an understanding amongiourselves--about what weA>Wll do--with the crowd at school, you know.iWeA>Wre going to have our fur rubbed the wrong way. ThereA>Wll be a lotiof ugly talk. There has been some, as you know, but thereA>Wll be more.iWeA>Wre going to be a pretty unpopular bunch for a while--and how are weigoing to take it?A>[iiA>ZHead on!A>[ cried Step. A>ZGive A>Wem as good as they send!A>[iiA>ZThatA>Ws the talk!A>[ vowed Herman Boyd.iiThen Orkney intervened. A>ZEasy there, fellows! LetA>Ws have SamA>Ws notion.A>[iiNow, Sam had done a deal of thinking about the case in all its aspects,iand had tried to put to practical use some of the lessons he hadilearned in the school of experience.iiA>ZWell, as I see it,A>[ he began, A>ZthereA>Ws only one way to settle thisithing, and settle it right.A>[iiA>ZBy punching a lot of heads!A>[ Step urged.iiA>ZNot a bit of it!

I know of one IA>Wll look after,A>[ said Orkney grimly.iiA>ZIA>Wve made a note of one, myself,A>[ said Sam in quite the same manner.iA>ZBut itA>Wll have to wait, and so will yours, Tom. Something elseicomes first, and thatA>Ws disproving the charge that the Trojan liediabout the book, and that I gave him away.... DonA>Wt interrupt! Let meifinish. The Trojan is innocent, and if he is innocent, there must beisome way to prove it. I didnA>Wt intentionally say a word to hurt him,iand if we clear his record, mineA>Wll be cleared, too. Somebody--notithe Trojan--took that book into the examination, and left it in theidesk where it was found. When we can show who did that, weA>Wre far onithe right road. They say murder will out, and if thatA>Ws so, I guessicrookedness will out, too. ItA>Ws what weA>Wve got to bank on, while weiwork as hard as we can to discover the truth and the whole truth. And,imeanwhile, we wonA>Wt be helping anybody by fighting and making theiscandal worse than it is. Our job will be to keep our heads, and haveiour eyes and ears open, and tutor the Trojan.A>[iiA>ZIf the principal will agree to let him take the final and to do theisquare thing about term marks,A>[ Poke supplemented.iiA>ZIA>Wll see the principal.A>[iiThere was a little pause. Poke rose from his ledge, and descended theislope of the council rock.iiA>ZIf we donA>Wt mean to keep Lon waiting, weA>Wd better adjourn theimeeting,A>[ he remarked. A>ZBut your notion may be all right, Sam--youA>Wveitraces of brains now and then. Only, your way isnA>Wt exactly quickiaction. ItA>Ws going to call for time, maybe a long time. And meanwhileiwe wonA>Wt be really enjoying life.A>[iiSam rose, too. A>ZYes, weA>Wre due to start, if weA>Wre to catch Lon,A>[ heisaid. A>ZBut if any of you fellows can offer a better scheme----A>[iiA>ZWe canA>Wt!A>[ said Orkney crisply.iiA>ZThen youA>Wre ready to try my way, even if it may seem slow?A>[iiA>ZYes,A>[ said the club, in chorus. A>ZWeA>Wll try it.A>[iiiiiCHAPTER V LON GOES SCOUTINGiiiWith Lon Gates it was not a case of A>Zout of sight, out of mind,A>[ so farias Sam was concerned.iiFor years Lon had taken a very keen interest in the fortunes andimisfortunes of Sam and his friends, had served as their confidantiand counselor, and had shared in some of their adventures. Naturalishrewdness and long acquaintance combined to give him a ratheriremarkable insight into their problems, which he found peculiarlyientertaining, on occasion. Lon, as he sometimes confessed, A>Zliked toifigger out things.A>[ It tickled his sense of humor, and possibly aniinnocent vanity, now and then to do a little detective work, so toispeak; get to the bottom of some case in which the boys were concerned;ithen amaze them by putting his knowledge to their practical service.iiIn the present instance Lon was disposed to regard SamA>Ws difficulty asipresumably fairly serious. Putting one thing with another, he inclinedito the theory that it grew out of incidents at school. Sam plainlyiregarded the trouble--whatever it might be--as real. Lon ran over inimind the chances for friction in studies, in athletics, in what mayibe called the social side of school life. So far as he had heard fromithe boys of the club, none of these offered especially rough places.iHe inferred that whatever had happened, had happened unexpectedly andirecently; doubtless, within a few hours. Lon whistled softly.iiA>ZThey say itA>Ws pooty near unanimously voted that it takes two to make aiquarrel,A>[ he soliloquized. A>ZThereA>Wll be Sam and his crowd, and thereA>Wllibe the other fellers. And mebbe the othersA>Wll be talkinA>W. I dunno of noijest cause and impediment why I shouldnA>Wt listen and keep my eyes doinA>Wibusiness as usual. And so--letA>Ws see--what weA>Wll see.A>[iiLon knew the town like a book. He knew the playgrounds and the favoriteilounging places. Moreover, he had ready excuse for visiting them. Thereiwere half a dozen errands to be done; he took the car and sallied forthion his round.iiA few small boys were playing on the high school grounds, but he didnA>Wtihalt to observe them; they were younger than the club and not likelyito be involved in its affairs. At street corners he noticed two orithree groups of high school pupils, and marked that they were talkingiearnestly. Then he came to the field where the baseball diamond wasilaid out, and where a scrub game was in progress. There was a fringe ofispectators about the field, and half a dozen cars and wagons were linediat the curb. Lon drew up behind a truck, whose driver was killing aispare quarter of an hour. The man on the truck nodded.iiA>ZHA>Wlo, Lon! How be?A>[iiA>ZFair to middlinA>W,A>[ said Lon. A>ZGuess if the weather man was diagnosinA>Wimy troubles heA>Wd be sayinA>W something about a faintly developed troughioA>W depression, but not flyinA>W no storm signals. And howA>Ws the rest oA>Withe Grand Lodge oA>W the Sons of Rest?A>[iiA>ZHoldinA>W protracted session, I guess,A>[ quoth the truckman cheerfully.iA>ZBusiness ainA>Wt what it used to be,A>[ he added with a sudden change ofinote.iiA>ZKinder lucky thing for business, at that,A>[ Lon countered. A>ZGot to keepiup with the times, you know--same as we do.... Say! WhoA>Ws at bat?A>[iiA>ZDunno. Guess he ainA>Wt one of the regA>Wlars.A>[iiA>ZDonA>Wt hold himself like one,A>[ Lon agreed. He ran his eye over theiplayers and spectators. There was something half-hearted about theigame, and the boys about the diamond were not displaying keen interestiin its progress. None of the club was in sight, but he recognized ainumber of SamA>Ws classmates, among them Ed Zorn.iiLon kept closely enough in touch with the affairs of his young friendsito be aware that Zorn and the Safety First boys were not on termsiof intimacy. It was a logical thing, therefore, for him to watch Edikeenly, his theory being that Sam was involved in some difficulty withihis schoolmates. Zorn, in other words, was as likely as anybody else toibe concerned in the dispute. So Lon studied the suspect. More, he madeia discovery or two.iiZorn, for one thing, was paying no attention to the game. He wasisauntering back and forth along the line behind first base, going fromione group to the next. Lon noted that almost invariably he became theicenter of a little cluster of boys, to whom he appeared to talk veryiearnestly for a moment or two. The performance was repeated so oftenithat Lon made up his mind there was method in it.iiA>ZThat feller makes me think of a ward worker before a caucus,A>[ heireflected. A>ZActs as if he wanted to get A>Wem all goinA>W his way, and wasihandinA>W out steerinA>W directions.... And thereA>Ws that other youngsteridanglinA>W after him, and wigglinA>W as oneasy as uninvited company thatA>Wsiheard the dinner bell ring and ainA>Wt been asked to draw up and set in.A>[iiThe lad to whom Lon referred was Hagle, whose movements and bearingijustified the comparison he had drawn. Hagle was behaving like aisatellite of Zorn, bearing him company, following him about, nowidrawing close, now retiring, uneasily alert for word of command. Loniwhistled softly.iiA>ZTalk about coach dogs runninA>W under a wagon or after it----A>[ he saidito himself. A>ZSomehow thatA>Ws kind of a poor job for a human. And thatifeller ainA>Wt gettinA>W the fun out of it that a dog does; he ainA>Wtihappy.... Funny, all A>Wround, ainA>Wt it?A>[iiThe truckman was yawning audibly. Lon gave him a glance.iiA>ZGoinA>W to be able to tear off a few more minutes from your pressinA>Wiengagements and stay here?A>[ he inquired. A>ZCan, eh? Then keep an eye onimy car, will you? Guess IA>Wll try for a close-up on that bush leaguinA>W.A>[iiA>ZHuh! NobodyA>Wll steal your old machine!A>[ grunted the other.iiA>ZNobody has--yet,A>[ said Lon drily. A>ZHate to give A>Wem a chance to formithe habit. All right! Back in a minute or two, or mebbe nine or ten.A>[iiLon glanced at his watch as he strolled away; he could spare a quarteriof an hour for the task in hand. He was grinning, a bit sheepishly.iiA>ZItA>Ws in the blood and you canA>Wt get it out--this taste for tryinA>Wito be a Shylock Holmes,A>[ he reflected. A>ZBut thereA>Ws something queeria-doinA>W, or IA>Wve got to start in and learn boys all over again.... Now,iletA>Ws see--what weA>Wll see.A>[iiJust then the batter sent up a long, high foul; a fielder and aibaseman came charging among the spectators; there was a scurrying ofimen and boys to avoid ball and players, and when the confusion hadisubsided and the ball, uncaught, had been retrieved, Lon found himselfineighbor to a cluster of youths with Zorn in the center of the ring.iiThere was a buzz of talk. Voices were not raised--Lon made mental noteiof the circumstance. Hagle was moving uneasily about the group--A>ZdoinA>Withe flea on the griddle dance,A>[ Lon called it. Then Zorn broke awayifrom the others. Hagle was after him instantly. He said something, andiZorn turned upon him menacingly. Hagle cowered, and shrank back. Zornimoved on, and Hagle trotted at his heels.iiIt was a curious performance; and it interested Lon. He might be wildlyioff the track in his suspicions, but, somehow, his theory that SamA>Wsitrouble and ZornA>Ws activities were related was growing stronger everyiminute. He saw Ed pause for a few words with other groups; reach theiend of the line; turn and retrace his steps, Hagle still following him.iiLon sat down on the ground. He clasped his arms about his knees, andistared industriously at the batter. His ears, though, were devoted toiwhat might be doing just behind him, where Zorn and Hagle were aboutito pass his station. They came along, Zorn at his easy pace and Jackishuffling closer. He was speaking eagerly, pleadingly, though Lon couldinot catch the words.iiAgain Zorn whipped about.iiA>ZOh, muzzle that whine, Jack!A>[ Lon heard this clearly enough. A>ZThisithingA>Ws working just right, I tell you.A>[iiA>ZI--I know, but----A>[ Lon lost the rest of it, for HagleA>Ws voice wasiweak.iiA>ZWell, if you know, act as if you _did_ know.A>[iiHagleA>Ws voice rose shrilly. A>ZI donA>Wt like it, Ed; I donA>Wt like it, Iisay!A>[iiZornA>Ws laugh was like the snap of a whip. A>ZGo home, then! You donA>Wtihave to be here.A>[iiA>ZBut--but I----A>[iiA>ZOh, keep quiet!A>[iiA>ZI canA>Wt. I donA>Wt like it.A>[iiA>ZYou donA>Wt have to like it.A>[iiA>ZIt isnA>Wt right; it isnA>Wt square; itA>Ws----A>[iiLon heard the slap of ZornA>Ws hand on HagleA>Ws shoulder.iiA>ZBrace up, Jack! Be sensible. When luckA>Ws running our way, make theimost of it. And you donA>Wt have to do anything--just let it run. Justibecause that gang happened----A>[iiThere Zorn broke off. Whether he had observed Lon and recognizedihim, or whether he thought he had said enough, anyway, Lon could notidetermine. Out of a corner of his eye, he saw Zorn leading Hagle away.iiLon got upon his feet. In very leisurely fashion he sauntered back toihis car.iiA>ZI reckon I know moreA>Wn I did a while ago,A>[ he told himself. A>ZStill,iIA>Wd give a pooty penny to know jest what A>Wtis I know. Good deal likeifindinA>W an old daguerreotype in the attic, and not beinA>W sure whetheriitA>Ws Uncle Simon that went to the legislater, or tA>Wother uncle thatiwent to jail. Guess IA>Wll have to do some thinkinA>W, but, at that,iI ainA>Wt ready to allow that IA>Wve altogether wasted my time thisiafternoon.A>[iiiiiCHAPTER VI POKE TAKES A FLYERiiiIt was nearly a mile from the council rock to the road on which theiclub was to meet Lon Gates on his return from the Ridge; and as theiafternoon was well advanced the boys made a forced march of it. All ofithem were panting from a dog-trot across the last field, when they cameito the highway, and saw the Parker car approaching at a leisurely pace.iSo, when Lon pulled up and grinned at them cheerfully, evidencing noidesire for haste, none of them was in a hurry to climb into the machine.iiA>ZWhat did you think of the pond?A>[ Lon inquired. A>ZAnd howA>Ws the moderniimprovements progressinA>W? GettinA>W to be quite meetropolitan, eh?A>[iiSam laughed. A>ZWe could see a lot of building going on, but we didnA>Wtinotice a crowd, Lon. Fact is, we stayed on the other side of the lake.A>[iiA>ZStumbled on a bully place and tied up there,A>[ Step contributed.iiLon wagged his head sagely. A>ZReckon you made the best pick, at that.iAs I remember it, the pootiest side of the pond is across from theisyndicateA>Ws land. And there used to be a big rock----A>[iiA>ZScooped out toward the water--like part of a saucer, you know?A>[ Pokeibroke in.iiA>ZThatA>Ws the feller.A>[iiA>ZWell, itA>Ws there yet.A>[iiLonA>Ws eyes twinkled. A>ZDo tell! And yet I donA>Wt know as itA>Ws soisurprisinA>W, rocks havinA>W a way oA>W stayinA>W put. Set a good example forifolks, donA>Wt they? But, as I was sayinA>W, I remember that old rock andithe fishinA>W we used to have jest opposite it--bass, mostly. And up backia piece was a spring. I tell you, boys, if I was goinA>W campinA>W at theipond, thatA>Ws jest about where IA>Wd tie up.A>[iiA>ZIt did seem to be a good place, and IA>Wd----A>[ Sam began, but paused inimid-sentence. A>ZWhy--whatA>Ws that?A>[iiEverybody had heard the sounds which had caught SamA>Ws attention. Upithe road, in the direction from which Lon had come, something wasihappening, something extraordinarily and violently noisy. There was aisuccession of reports; then a broken and uneven rattle; then anotheriseries of explosions, louder than before and evidently nearer.iiA>ZGreat Scott! It must be a machine-gun!A>[ gasped Step.iiA>ZIf it is, weA>Wll have to duck,A>[ said Herman Boyd. A>ZThe thingA>Ws comingithis way.A>[iiA>ZAnd here it is!A>[ cried Poke.ii[Illustration: SOMETHING SHOT INTO VIEW]iiSomething shot into view, a black something which was raising aitremendous cloud of dust and which was traveling at reckless speed.iLon shouted a warning to the boys to stand aside, threw on his power,iand steered his car far into the ditch. As he did so, it was as if airoaring cyclone swept past. The noise of it deafened the club, the dustiit sent swirling in clouds choked them, its velocity dazed them. Thatithe cause of the commotion was an automobile they realized, but none ofithem had an idea what manner of car it might be, or, indeed, how manyipassengers it carried.iiLon steered back into the road.iiA>ZAll aboard, everybody!A>[ he called. A>ZThereA>Ws a feller thatA>Ws findinA>Withe goinA>W too good to last. LetA>Ws follow and see if we can pick upienough oA>W the pieces to tell what kind of a machine A>Wtwas.A>[iiNo second invitation was needed. The boys swarmed into the touring car.iiA>ZHurry!A>[ Sam urged. A>ZThat fellowA>Ws in trouble now. You canA>Wt hear hisiengine any more.A>[iiIt was quite true. The loud reports had ceased abruptly; there were noisounds from beyond the bend in the road where the speeding driver hadivanished.iiLon gave his young friends an excellent exhibition of how fast aicareful chauffeur can go, on occasion. But he had not far to go--lessithan a quarter-mile, in fact. Then he was throwing on his brakes, andiwhistling shrilly as he did so.iiThe other car--or what was left of it--was across the ditch. It lay oniits side, with its front axle jammed against a boulder. The cover ofithe hood had been torn off, and the engine was exposed. The leather topiwas in ribbons; the cushions had vanished. One back wheel lay againstithe stone wall bordering the road.iiA>ZJee-ru-salem!A>[ Lon exclaimed. A>ZIA>Wll bet a lot oA>W things happened toithe citizen managinA>W that joy ride, and happened all of a sudden! Butiwhere is he?A>[iiAs if in answer a figure raised itself beyond the wall. Lon drew a longibreath of relief.iiA>ZSay, but I thought he must A>WaA>W been killed, sure for sartain! ItA>Ws aniamazinA>W mercy heA>Ws got a leg left to stand on!A>[iiWith that, Lon was out of the car, and striding to the strangerA>Ws aid,ithe boys pressing closely behind him. But, as the event proved, thereiwas very little for them to do.iiThe man--he was a tall, gaunt person with a wisp of chin beard--seemedito have come to no great bodily harm, though his clothing was rippediand torn, his hat was missing, and the sole of one of his shoes flappedilike a loose slipper when he moved. From the clump of brush, into whichihe had been projected, and which mercifully had broken the force ofihis fall, he limped forward, a step at a time, pausing to bend a knee,itest an elbow, or otherwise investigate the extent of his injuries. Lonitried to offer him a supporting arm, but was waved back.iiA>ZNo; let me stand on my own feet, Mister--kinder a luxury I find it toibe able to,A>[ said the man. A>ZSay, but we must A>WaA>W been goinA>W some!A>[iiA>ZAll oA>W that--and then a little more,A>[ Lon assured him.iiThe man rubbed his eyes. A>ZI dunnoA>Ws I happen to know you folks, but IicalA>Wlate youA>Wre the crowd I passed a rod or so back.A>[iiA>ZCall it a couple oA>W forty-rods.A>[iiA>ZWell, mebbe. There was sort of a blur side of the road, but IA>Wd gotiother things to think about. And say! was we touchinA>W ground anywhereiwhen we went by you?A>[iiA>ZNot as I noticed,A>[ Lon told him.iiThe man nodded. A>ZShe was a goer, all right, that machine! But sheiwaA>WnA>Wt no ladyA>Ws drivinA>W car. Feller that let me have her said that,iand, by gum, he hit it!A>[iiA>ZLooks that way,A>[ Lon agreed. A>ZBut donA>Wt you belong over Watervilleiway? And ainA>Wt your name Haskins? A>WTis, eh? Thought IA>Wd seen youibefore.A>[iiA>ZOh, IA>Wm Jabe Haskins, sure enough,A>[ said the other. A>ZDonA>Wt wonder youididnA>Wt recognize me fust-off.

Whew! but IA>Wm all one ache, and dentedifrom one end of me to the other!A>[iiA>ZCourse, if you want to over-speed----A>[ Lon began, but Haskins cut himishort.iiA>ZA>WTwaA>WnA>Wt what I wanted to do, Mister, but what that blessed machineidid.

So we settled a trade, we did, anditA>Wother party showed me how to set her goinA>W, and I climbed aboard andistarted out to give her a warminA>W-up jog, as you might say. But lookihere, Mister! we hit a race gait right off, and the more I tried toipull her in, the more we touched only the high places. So all I couldido was to hope to hold the track and wait for her to run down--whichialso she didnA>Wt. Say, what do you sA>Wpose was the matter? Feller I gotiher from--heA>Ws a left-hander, he is.

WaA>WnA>Wt half-broke, she waA>WnA>Wt!A>[iiLon stepped back and inspected the wreck in the ditch.iiA>ZDunnoA>Ws I can quite place this machine,A>[ he said presently. A>ZStrangeimake to me. Never saw one like it before.A>[iiA>ZGood reason--there ainA>Wt no other like her. Only one made and thenithey bust the mold. Leastwise, thatA>Ws what the party said.A>[iiA>ZUmph!A>[ said Lon. He was still looking closely at the car, whichiwas--or had been--a runabout or roadster, with a single seat, very highibacked, and a peculiarly lumpy, box-like construction at the rear.iiMr. Haskins took a few limping steps, groaning slightly. It was plainienough that, while he had escaped broken bones, he must be sorelyibruised. He glared for a moment at the ruins.iiA>ZParty allowed he built her himself,A>[ he explained. A>ZLet on he--heiassembled her himself--yes, thatA>Ws what he called it, assembled.

Mr. Haskins, having recovered his balance, resumedihis observations:iiA>ZWal, I reckon I was givinA>W a pooty fair imitation of flyinA>W, myself.iBut A>WtwaA>WnA>Wt no business for a man of my age and habits to be in--Iisee that before weA>Wd gone a hundred yards.

As he passed Step, he touched his arm. Sam in a moment moreisaw the two, with their heads together, conferring earnestly.iiLon made a leisurely circuit of the wreck, inspecting it from allipoints of view.

PokeA>Ws debts, as earlier accounts of theiaffairs of the Safety First Club have related, followed an unhappyiepisode, in which a costly vase was destroyed. With the help of hisichums, Poke had paid the bill, but the contributions had taxed theiriresources.iiA>ZWell, I mean to pay you fellows back, and I think I see a way to doiit. IA>Wve told Step, and heA>Ws strong for the scheme.A>[iiA>ZOh, is he?A>[ SamA>Ws tone was not enthusiastic; Step was more likely toibe a sympathizer than a coolly calculating counselor.iiA>ZYou bet he is!

Poke blanched, but ofiall concerned Mr. Haskins appeared to be most deeply affected. Thereiwas something like a sob in his voice as he said:iiA>ZOh, come now!

And it was the same with the Trojan--with Walker, that is.iBoth of us were tangled, and twisted--and--and----A>[iiA>ZYes?A>[ the principal encouraged.iiA>ZWell, and tricked,A>[ said Sam.iiThe head of the school glanced at him sharply. A>ZThatA>Ws an ugly word,iParker,A>[ he said curtly.iiSam reddened, but held his ground. A>ZI donA>Wt mean that it was intendediso, but it worked like a trick, sir. If the book had been shown to theiTrojan right at the start, and heA>Wd been asked if it was his, heA>Wd haveisaid it was and made no bones about it, even if he hadnA>Wt a notion howiyou came to have it. But he was asked first where his Cicero was. Now,ihe hadnA>Wt missed it, and supposed it was with the rest of his books,iand----A>[iiA>ZYouA>Wre making a statement, Parker, that it might be difficult toiprove.A>[iiA>ZI know that, sir. But I know, too, how it could happen that the TrojanididnA>Wt miss his Cicero. There had been no Latin recitation for ouriclass since the test; he had had no occasion to look for the book.A>[iiA>ZYet we had your word for it, Parker, that he had it with him at theitime of the examination.A>[iiA>ZNo, sir--just before the time. ThatA>Ws a big difference.A>[iiA>ZAdmitted!A>[ said the principal drily.iiA>ZJust outside the room I borrowed the Cicero for a moment. Then I gaveiit back--the Trojan wanted it. Then the bell rang and we left our booksiin the corridor.A>[iiA>ZDid Walker?A>[iiA>ZYes, sir.A>[iiA>ZHow can you be sure he did? Did you see him leave his text there?A>[iiA>ZI didnA>Wt see him--at least, I didnA>Wt notice. But he says he did, and Iibelieve him.A>[iiThe principal was eyeing Sam keenly. There was a brief pause. Then saidihe:iiA>ZYouA>Wve something to add? Go on!A>[iiSam summoned all his resolution. A>ZI was talking about being tricked. Iiwas caught, too, by the way the questions were put. Somehow, I seemedito be made to give the Trojan away. I hadnA>Wt any notion of doing that,iand there wasnA>Wt any reason why I should, seeing that he hadnA>Wt doneianything wrong. But Mr. Bacon seemed to tangle both of us up. Do youiremember, sir, how he didnA>Wt go straight at the thing, but fussediaround it, and--and----A>[iiA>ZI do remember,A>[ said the principal, when Sam hesitated. There wasisomething in his tone which reminded the boy of his curious doubt thatithe head of the school had really approved the course the inquisitionitook.iiA>ZWell, sir, in the end I appeared to have done the Trojan a lot ofiharm, and heA>Wd harmed himself, and it was all a mix-up. ThatA>Ws what Iimeant by the trick part.A>[iiA>ZI see,A>[ said the principal. Again there was a pause.iiA>ZThe Trojan is honest,A>[ was the way Sam resumed the discussion.iiA>ZParker, let me show you the other side of the case,A>[ said theiprincipal quietly. A>ZFor some time we have had reason to believe thatithere has been cheating in examinations, and have been keeping a closeiwatch on all the classes. There is, as you know, a strict rule againstitaking text-books into rooms where examinations are held. In thisicase, after your class had taken Latin papers, a Cicero was found inione of the desks. We established, beyond doubt, that it was the deskiWalker had used. There was evidence that the book was his. When he wasiquestioned, opportunity was given him to make confession----A>[iiA>ZBut that was prejudging him guilty, sir!A>[iiThe principal coughed. A>ZI get your point, Parker, but must remind youithat we are interested rather in maintaining discipline and doingiessential justice, than in following rules of court procedure.iWalkerA>Ws course was unfortunate. It certainly did not serve to lessenithe strong presumption of his guilt.A>[iiA>ZBut what was I brought in for?A>[iiA>ZTo assist in establishing all available facts. And you furnished someiinformation, which surely bore directly upon the question at issue.A>[iiA>ZI know--it seemed to,A>[ Sam admitted dismally. A>ZThatA>Ws the hardestipart, so far as IA>Wm concerned.A>[iiA>ZI understand your position,A>[ the principal told him, not unkindly.iiSam took thought for a moment. A>ZWell, sir, thereA>Ws another side to theicase--whatA>Ws the Trojan to do, that is. And--and--was he given a markion that Latin paper?A>[iiA>ZA mark of zero.A>[iiA>ZAfterward--yes. But was there a mark to begin with?A>[iiA>ZYes,A>[ said the principal. He opened his desk, took out three or fourisheets of paper, closely written in a hand Sam recognized as theiTrojanA>Ws. A>ZAll the papers were marked at once, as it happened. Walkeriwas given an eighty-two. That was canceled, of course, after theiinvestigation, and is out of the reckoning.A>[iiA>ZI donA>Wt think it should be, sir,A>[ Sam argued. A>ZItA>Ws important. If theiTrojan had been doing any crooked work, heA>Wd have turned in a betteripaper. He usually has had eighty-five or more in examinations.A>[iiThe principal consulted a record-book.iiA>ZQuite true,A>[ he admitted. A>ZLetA>Ws see! HereA>Ws an eighty-seven--thatiwas a test; he fell just under eighty-five in the next one, butipicked up again at mid-yearA>Ws. Then I find an eighty-six and next anieighty-seven.A>[iiA>ZAll higher than eighty-two,A>[ Sam pointed out.iiA>ZGranted. I canA>Wt grant, though, direct application to the mainiquestion before us.A>[iiA>ZWhich is that you think the Trojan lied?A>[ Sam asked bluntly.iiA>ZThat is certainly the most serious aspect of the case.A>[iiSam reflected swiftly. A>ZWell, sir,A>[ he said, A>ZIA>Wm sure he didnA>Wt lie,iand I believe some day we can prove he didnA>Wt. But, meanwhile, weA>Wveigot to figure on what he can do. That zero will smash his term-stand.iAs he isnA>Wt to be allowed to recite with the class in Latin, heA>Wllihave no chance to pull it up; so, even if he came in for the final andidid mighty well, heA>Wd probably be flunked.A>[iiA>ZIt might be.A>[iiA>ZWell, I--we--his friends, I mean--donA>Wt want to have him flunked. WeA>Wdido anything to prevent it. And that brings me to something weA>Wd like toihave arranged and understood. If the Trojan keeps up in his Latin byioutside work, and this--this other thing is cleared up, and he passesithe final, what can be done about his term marks?A>[iiIt was plain that the principal, if not persuaded of the TrojanA>Wsiinnocence, was impressed by SamA>Ws earnestness.iiA>ZIf your hopes can be realized, Parker, and if we can be shown thatiWalker is a victim of circumstances--I warn you, itA>Ws a difficult taskiyou appear to have set yourself--if you can clear his record, you canidepend upon me to give him fair play.A>[iiA>ZThen youA>Wll fix the term-stand part of it?A>[ Sam insisted.iiA>ZYes--on condition the other requirement is met.A>[iiA>ZThat we prove he didnA>Wt take the Cicero into the room, and supposedithe book was with the rest of his lot?A>[iiThe principal smiled. A>ZProof of the second proposition, Parker, mightibe beyond even the efforts of the strongest friendship. I fear evidenceiof his mental processes cannot be secured. But if you can establishithe fact that he did not have his text with him that day, while he wasiworking on his paper, it will be quite enough. Convince me of so much,iand youA>Wll have no cause to complain--nor will he.A>[iiA>ZHurrah!A>[ cried Sam, delightedly.iiThere might have been doubt in the principalA>Ws expression, but thereiwas surely a trace of sympathy.iiA>ZParker, I wish you success in your efforts, though I am notioversanguine. But you can be assured of this: if we are in error inipunishing Walker, weA>Wll make every effort to make amends.A>[iiA>ZI understand, sir. And all we want is a square deal.A>[iiA>ZPrecisely,A>[ said the principal, and there was the suspicion of aitwinkle in his eye. A>ZPrecisely. The trouble, though, is that on theiface of the returns, that is just what Walker is getting now.A>[iiA>ZThen weA>Wll change the returns!A>[ Sam declared valiantly.iiA>ZA>WPon my word, Parker, I shall be very glad to see you do it--if youican!A>[ said the head of the school.iiiiiCHAPTER VIII DRAWING THE LINEiiiAfterward the club was agreed that many things might have happenedidifferently, had it not been for the affair of the class secretary.iBut the affair took place, and in its effects had an importance beyondianybodyA>Ws expectations.iiAs a matter of fact, class officers had little to do except in Senioriyear, when the ceremonies and festivities of graduation increased theiriduties. Several weeks before the troubles of the Trojan and his friendsibegan the JuniorsA>W secretary had left school, but it had been supposedithat the class would not elect a successor for the balance of the term.iThere was, therefore, more or less surprise when a notice was posted,icalling a class meeting to fill the vacancy.iiSam Parker was especially disturbed. There had been some mention ofithe Trojan as a candidate for secretary at the regular election atithe beginning of Senior year, and though Sam himself, as well as someiof the other members of the club, expected to transfer to St. MarkA>Ws,ia famous fitting school, for the last year of their preparation foricollege, Walker had intended to finish the course at the high school.iIn the call for a special election Sam saw a hostile move: the Trojan,iin official disgrace, could hardly hope to be chosen, while theisuccessful candidate would, doubtless, seek re"ilection in Senior yeariwith the prestige of one victory.iiSam had been having his full share of difficulty, anyway, in dealingiwith the Trojan. Walker had taken greatly to heart what he consideredithe essential injustice of his treatment, and though he kept hisipledge not to leave the school, there was little energy in his work.iFrom Latin recitations he was barred, as we know. In the case of theiothers he did little more than file appearance. Sam, doing his best toiencourage his chum, was alarmed by the probable results of the classimeeting and the almost certain slight upon the Trojan.iiThe club held council, and bade Sam have charge of the campaign.iAccordingly, he took special care to be early at the meeting, and, asisoon as it was opened, to offer a resolution to delay action on theichoice of a temporary secretary. Step lost no time in seconding theimotion.iiBut if the club had laid its plans, so, too, had the opposition. Two orithree boys spoke against postponement. They were influential fellows asiit chanced, and their words carried weight. Then one of the girls tookithe floor, and made a strong plea for immediate action. Sam, keenlyiwatching his classmates, gained two distinct impressions. One was thatisentiment was overwhelmingly against him; the other, that though Zornitook no part in the debate, he was the guiding spirit of the otheriside; for once or twice questioning glances were turned upon him andiwere met by a nod or a shake of the head, as the case might be.iiWhen SamA>Ws motion was put to a vote, it met defeat. The chorus ofiA>ZNoesA>[ gave unmistakable evidence of the prevailing sentiment. Then theiclass president called for nominations for secretary.iiSomebody in the rear of the room sang out A>ZScrub Payne!A>[ Two or threeiothers seconded the nomination almost simultaneously.iiA>ZAnybody else?A>[ inquired the president.iiJack Hagle rose to his feet. A>ZI--I want to nominate Trojan Walker,A>[ heisaid, unsteadily.iiSam whirled in his seat to stare at Hagle, who took special pains toiavoid his eye.iiA>ZNomination seconded?A>[ asked the president briskly.iiSam sent a warning glance at his club-mates. His wits were working, andirealizing that the Trojan could not be elected, he meant to do his bestito spare him the humiliation of a defeat.iiA>ZSeconded!A>[iiAgain it was a contribution from the back of the room; Sam was not sureiwhich of a group of half a dozen boys spoke.iiA>ZAny further nominations?A>[ queried the president. A>ZIf not, we williproceed to vote.A>[iiSam sprang up. A>ZI wish to withdraw WalkerA>Ws name,A>[ he said. A>ZHe is notia candidate.A>[iiA murmur of surprise greeted the statement. Plainly enough, this was aniunexpected development.iiThe presidentA>Ws face betrayed perplexity. Sam made a shrewd guessiat the situation: Joe Carson had won the presidency by courtingipopularity, and this seemed to be turning into an affair in which thatipopularity might suffer.iiA>ZYes, I withdraw WalkerA>Ws name,A>[ Sam repeated.iiA>ZWhy--why--I hardly know----A>[ the president began.iiA>ZWait a minute, Carson--Mr. President, I mean,A>[ interposed Zorn. A>ZLetiWalker speak for himself.A>[iiA>ZHe isnA>Wt here--as you mighty well know!A>[ cried Sam hotly.iiThe chairman rapped sharply with his gavel. A>ZOrder, please! LetA>Ws doithis according to the rules. Zorn has the floor.A>[iiA>ZI wonA>Wt need it long,A>[ said Zorn coolly. A>ZMy point is a simple one.iWhen a fellow has been nominated and seconded, he has to be votedion unless he himself withdraws. And if Walker doesnA>Wt want to beiconsidered, he ought to have been willing to take the trouble to comeihere and say so. Everybody knows his crowd has been booming him forithis job. If heA>Ws changed his mind, why isnA>Wt he here to let us knowiabout it?A>[iiNow, as it chanced, Sam had not urged the TrojanA>Ws attendance, and,iindeed, had deemed it wiser that he stay away from the meeting. Thisiwas hardly a matter for public discussion, however. Step saved theisituation by creating a diversion. Up he shot like a jack in the box.iiA>ZThis is a shame!A>[ he shouted. A>ZItA>Ws a set-up job! I wonA>Wt stand foriit! Everybody knows ZornA>Ws a trouble maker, but I didnA>Wt know till nowihe could bamboozle nearly the whole class into helping in his dirtyiwork!A>[iiThe chairmanA>Ws gavel was beating a tattoo on his desk. Sam caughtiStepA>Ws coat and dragged him down into his seat. Zorn scowled, but keptihis head.iiA>ZI say that in WalkerA>Ws absence nobody is entitled to speak for himiwithout his authority--ought to be in writing, at that.A>[iiThe president caught at the suggestion. A>ZYou make that a point ofiorder?A>[iiA>ZYes,A>[ said Zorn.iiCarson turned to Sam. A>ZHave you any authority?A>[iiA>ZSure he has!A>[ Step broke in; but the declaration went unheeded.iiA>ZIA>Wve no authority, in writing,A>[ Sam said quietly. A>ZBut I donA>Wt neediit. I donA>Wt admit ZornA>Ws point is well taken.A>[iiA>ZI rule it is,A>[ said the president.iiA>ZThen IA>Wll appeal to the class.A>[iiBut the class was not with Sam. The vote against him and in support ofithe chair was five or six to one.iiStep groaned loudly. Then informally but perfectly audibly he expressedihis opinion of plots and plotters. Angry murmurs rose from the otheriside. The chairman pounded the desk lustily.iiOrkney with difficulty gained recognition.iiA>ZI move we adjourn,A>[ he said.iiA>ZSecond the motion!A>[ cried Poke.iiA>ZMr. President, thatA>Ws out of order,A>[ Zorn objected.iiA>ZMotion to adjournA>Ws always in order,A>[ Sam insisted.iiA>ZNot with the vote on a secretary pending--you canA>Wt side-track it thatiway.A>[iiBy this time half a dozen members of the class were on their feet.iParliamentary practice was supposed to be one of the benefits of theseimeetings, and this day the Juniors were trying to put to use all theyiknew about methods of procedure.iiCarson was not enjoying his authority as presiding officer, but in hisidesire to stand with the majority made up his mind to rule OrkneyA>Wsiresolution out of order.iiTumult greeted his announcement. Zorn and his followers applauded;iStep, Poke, Herman Boyd and Orkney made loud protest. The Shark,iunmoved, calmly watched the proceedings through his big spectacles. Samiwas busy with plans for the next move. He understood perfectly thatithe voting strength was against him; that a carefully arranged plan toihumiliate the Trojan, and through him the Safety First Club, was beingicarried out; that he could not avert the election of a secretary, andithat all that was left for him was to soften the blow so far as heimight.iiA>ZVote! Vote now!A>[ Somebody raised the cry, and many voices repeated it.iiThe Shark rose in leisurely fashion. Somehow, though he did not seem toiraise his voice, he managed to make himself heard.iiA>ZWritten ballots, then--do it the right way!A>[iiA>ZNo, no!A>[ A>ZWhatA>Ws the use?A>[ A>ZMake it a standing vote!A>[ There was aimedley of objections.iiSam gratefully caught at the SharkA>Ws hint. He had no hope, now, ofiavoiding defeat, but it flashed upon him that a secret vote would giveiopportunity to learn the real division of sentiment in the class.iThere might be a number of boys and girls who would yield to populariclamor, if called upon to declare themselves openly, but who would voteiaccording to their true preferences under the protection of a secretiballot.iiA>ZExcept by unanimous consent otherwise, elections have to be byiballot,A>[ he declared, vigorously.iiCarson hesitated. Before he could speak, the Shark cut in:iiA>ZOf course! Rule--rule everywhere!A>[iiA>ZShow us the rule!A>[ somebody called out.iiA>ZNo need--if you know anything, you know IA>Wm right,A>[ said the Sharkicontemptuously, and sat down.iiZorn shrugged his shoulders, as if the point at issue had littleiinterest; and the president, upon whom the demonstration was not lost,ireached decision.iiA>ZWeA>Wll take a ballot. IA>Wll appoint Bert Brown and Herman Boyd tellers.iThey can prepare the slips, and then collect and count them.A>[iiAs the two boys named went forward to the desk, Step whispered to Sam:iA>ZWhat shall we do? Cast blanks? WeA>Wre licked, anyway.A>[iiSam shook his head. A>ZNo; weA>Wll see how many friends we have left. If itihad been a standing vote, we might have let it go by default, but now Iiwant to find out what the line-up is.A>[iiWith Sam, Orkney, Step, Poke, Herman and the Shark, the club couldicount upon six votes for the Trojan. The tally gave him fiveimore--eleven in all. Scrub Payne had forty-one.iiThe meeting was over, and the club had fared badly. Sam and hisifriends were close together when they left the room; and it is to beirelated that nobody tried to force his company upon them. Just thenithe line was very sharply drawn between the two factions into whichithe class had divided. In fact, as if to emphasize the division, whileithe club kept on the right side of the street, the great body of theiother party chose the left in leaving the school grounds. Step, in aifine rage, was vowing vengeance on Zorn and the rest, Herman and Pokeioccasionally adding suggestions of ways and means. Orkney and the Sharkitrudged along in silence, which in the case of the former had a touchiof doggedness. The Shark appeared to be merely indifferent. Sam beganito lag a little. There were perhaps a dozen stragglers, who could notibe said to have attached themselves to either of the rival groups, andiamong these, no doubt, were the five outsiders who had voted with theiclub. Sam tried to puzzle out which had been his allies. The meetingihad made it evident that the feud which had developed in the class wasiserious enough to indicate a long struggle; and he was anxious to knowiwhom he could depend upon.iiAs a matter of fact, his observations brought him little light. Someifellows whom he had deemed his very good friends were openly with Zorn;itwo or three others--among them Jack Hagle--with whom he had not beenion especially good terms, were among the stragglers. So busy was heiwith his problem that he failed to notice that he had fallen quite aidistance behind his club-mates, and had been passed by one or two ofithe strays. He did observe, however, that Hagle was beginning to sidleitoward him.iiWondering what might be in the wind, Sam slackened his pace. Hagleidrew nearer. What Sam sometimes had called his A>Zhang-dogA>[ manner wasipeculiarly in evidence. For a moment or two the pair walked side byiside. Then Hagle spoke, nervously, propitiatingly:iiA>ZSay, Parker! I--I voted for Walker.A>[iiSam turned and stared at him. A>ZYou? You----A>[iiA>ZYes, I did!A>[iiA>ZWell, why in thunder shouldnA>Wt you?A>[ Sam demanded with sudden heat.iA>ZYouA>Wd got him into the mess by nominating him, hadnA>Wt you?A>[iiA>ZI--I thought he ought to have it.A>[iiSam laughed harshly. A>ZTell that to somebody else! Much you thoughtiabout what he ought to have! All you and your crowd wanted was to putihim up so that you could knock him down!A>[iiA>ZBut I voted for him, I tell you!A>[ Hagle protested.iiA>ZThen Zorn ordered you to do that, too.A>[iiHagle reddened, but would not meet SamA>Ws gaze.iiA>ZA>WTisnA>Wt so! He didnA>Wt want me to----A>[ There he checked himself.iA>ZHe--he--I mean, I acted on my own hook. Zorn didnA>Wt make me do it. Theiclass has been talking Walker for secretary for weeks, and--and--say,iParker, I figured that because heA>Ws down on his luck, he--heA>Wd feelibetter if something came his way. I was square about it.A>[iiA>ZBosh! You knew the game had been fixed to beat him!A>[iiHagle wriggled. A>ZI knew Scrub Payne was going to run, but I thoughtiWalker ought to have his show. Look here! I--IA>Wm awfully sorry aboutithe whole business--about all WalkerA>Ws troubles. It--itA>Ws mighty hardiluck for him.A>[iiA>ZIt surely is!A>[ said Sam drily.iiHagle began to edge away. A>ZI voted for him, and I wanted to tell youiso. That--thatA>Ws all.A>[iiA>ZYouA>Wve told!A>[ Sam growled.iiThe other widened the distance between them. A>ZWell, that--thatA>Ws alliIA>Wve got to say,A>[ he mumbled.iiSam made no answer. Hagle seemed to expect none, for he continued toidraw away from the leader of the Safety First Club, and did not lookiback.iiiiiCHAPTER IX THE CLUB FORMS HOLLOW SQUAREiiiIt meant war. The result of the class meeting was so accepted byiboth the club and its opponents; and though Sam speculated long andiearnestly on the reasons for the sudden enmity, he did not attemptito deceive himself about the ugly fact. It was plain that somebodyiwas shrewdly taking advantage of the situation to work harm for theiSafety Firsts, and he had no doubt of the identity of the schemer. WhyiZorn should have been moved to this pernicious activity Sam did notiknow: mere lack of friendliness hardly explained it. Zorn had spreadithe story of the TrojanA>Ws disaster, and had added a most unfavorableiversion of SamA>Ws participation. He had worked on popular prejudiceiagainst both a cheat and a telltale. These things were to be regardedias accomplished. The practical question remained, what was to be doneiabout them?iiSam had no ready answer to the question. The most he could do was toicounsel prudence to the more radical and excitable of the club, urgeiall the members to watch carefully for anything which might have aibearing upon the affair of the Trojan, and advise especially closeistudy of the doings of Zorn, in an effort to discover, among otherithings, the cause of his active enmity. On this point the other membersiof the club could give Sam little light. There had been no bitteriquarrel with Zorn; none of the boys could recall any ground for aniabiding grudge.iiAs was to be expected, the club drew closer together than ever. Itiformed hollow square, as it were, against all attacks. On its side, theiother faction showed no desire for reconciliation.iiSpring usually saw a series of inter-class baseball games. This yeariwas no exception to the rule; but none of the Safety Firsts playedion the Junior nine. The Trojan, perhaps the best second baseman inithe school, was passed over; Tom Orkney and Sam, both fair players,iwere left out. Even the Shark, highly esteemed as an inerrant scorer,iwas refused recognition. The slights were deliberate, inescapable,iundeniable. And baseball was but one among many instances of theifeeling of the majority of the class.iiOn the clubA>Ws part all this was received defiantly. Cold shoulderiwas met by cold shoulder. Sam had no difficulty in keeping his chumsiin line. Orkney aided him greatly in the task of coaching the Trojaniin Latin, and added timely and encouraging suggestions, which wereisorely needed. Still smarting under the sense of essentially unfairitreatment, the Trojan would have been glad to quit the school. Againiand again he rebelled at appearing at the recitations he was permittedito attend, and it required all of SamA>Ws tact and firmness and OrkneyA>Wsiencouragement to hold him to his work under the existing conditions.iHerman Boyd also lent a hand occasionally, although he was not of muchihelp as a tutor. As for the Shark, he went his way imperturbably. Giveihim a sufficiency of his beloved mathematics, and he cared not a strawifor the opinion of the multitude. Poke and Step had developed someimysterious interest of their own, which kept them busy of afternoonsiin PokeA>Ws barn. Sam asked no questions about their enterprise. If theyiwished to hold it a secret, he had no objections.iiSam, in these days, though, felt the double burden of responsibilityiand unpopularity. Lon Gates, who made it a business to observe himiclosely, noted his preoccupation and demanded the cause.iiA>ZLetA>Ws put our heads together, Sam,A>[ he advised. A>ZThey say itA>Ws likeilumps oA>W sugar in a cup oA>W coffee--twoA>Ws betterA>Wn one. Come now! Outiwith it!A>[iiSam hesitated. A>ZI--I--whatA>Wd be the use?A>[iiA>ZDunno yet; thatA>Ws for the pair of us to find out.A>[iiA>ZBut----A>[iiA>ZBut, to begin with,A>[ said Lon briskly, A>ZwhatA>Ws Ed Zorn got againstiyou?A>[iiA>ZEd Zorn? WhoA>Ws been telling you? I didnA>Wt let it out, did I?A>[iiA>ZDunno what you may have been talkinA>W in your sleep, but IA>Wll acquitiyou on what youA>Wve said while awake.A>[iiA>ZHow did you find out?A>[iiA>ZMebbe I hainA>Wt found much--IA>Wd like to know jest how much. ThatA>Ws whyiIA>Wm cominA>W to headquarters and askinA>W you.A>[iiSam cherished independence, but at heart he welcomed this opening toitalk things over.iiA>ZTell me what youA>Wve heard,A>[ he suggested.iiA>ZAfter you, sonny--mebbe,A>[ said Lon. A>ZFire ahead!A>[iiThen Sam told his story, Lon listening most attentively.iiA>ZUmph! Fits like the two ends of a busted wish-bone,A>[ he declared.iiA>ZShow me your end, then,A>[ urged Sam.iiA>ZNo. You go on. YouA>Wve said whatA>Ws happened to your crowd. Now, whatiare you tryinA>W to have happen to other folks?A>[iiSam explained what the club had done. A>ZWeA>Wre sticking together, oficourse,A>[ he added. A>ZWeA>Wre trying to keep the Trojan up to the mark.A>[iiA>ZHard work?A>[iiSam grinned a little wryly. A>ZIt isnA>Wt as hard as it is going to be--Iican see that clearly enough.A>[iiA>ZGesso--itA>Ws the stickinA>W part oA>W the plaster that worries--and thatidoes the real good in the long run.A>[iiA>ZBut you havenA>Wt told your part of the story yet,A>[ Sam pointed out.iiA>ZA>WTainA>Wt a whole lot. It merely bears out your notion that Zorn isigunninA>W for you. But whatA>Ws his reason?A>[iiA>ZI donA>Wt know,A>[ Sam confessed. A>ZWeA>Wve been more or less on the outs,ibut there was no trouble to justify such a grudge as he must have.A>[iiLon nodded. A>ZMy notion, too--from what IA>Wd picked up by scoutinA>W round.iAnd I have been seeinA>W and hearinA>W all there was to hear and see, Sam.A>[iiA>ZWhatA>Ws your theory, then?A>[iiA>ZTheoryA>Ws too strong a word--make it guess.iiA>ZWell, my guess is that if I was goinA>W to prescribe for your case, IA>Wdidose you for politics--school politics. And if that guess is right,iI donA>Wt wonder youA>Wre worried. ItA>Ws your fust attack, and a felleriwith his fust touch oA>W politics is a good deal like a chap gettinA>Wiacquainted with the hives--he feels as if he was in trouble all over.A>[iiSam grinned again. A>ZYou talk as if youA>Wd had experience, Lon.A>[iiA>ZUmph! Guess I had! Run for third selectman once.A>[iiA>ZAnd they beat you?A>[iiA>ZThey didnA>Wt--that was jest the difficulty. I learned fast enough. AndiI got enough. I was willinA>W to doff the spangles and retire to privateilife after one term, I tell you!A>[iiA>ZWhat happened to you?A>[iiA>ZA-plenty! But itA>Ws your case weA>Wre discussinA>W.

So would the fellers in your class know it,iif they stopped to think over the kind oA>W goods youA>Wre made of. Butithey ainA>Wt stoppinA>W to think, because the somebody whoA>Ws raisinA>W allithe Cain is keepinA>W A>Wem goinA>W. ItA>Ws a heap like drivinA>W cattle.

The driver at your school is takinA>W care not to let the herdistop and the dust settle. Pooty good manager, he is!A>[iiSam nodded. A>ZYes--if you call it managing.A>[iiLon was silent for a moment. Then said he, gravely:iiA>ZIA>Wve been talkinA>W to you about politics. Now, thereA>Ws good politics,iand thereA>Ws bad politics; but IA>Wm mortal sure itA>Ws bad politics youA>WreifacinA>W.

But, after all, that ainA>Wt the mainipA>Wint--which is, what are you goinA>W to do about it?A>[iiA>ZWhy--why, IA>Wve tried to tell you.A>[iiA>ZYouA>Wve told more about what youA>Wve done than about what youA>Wre goinA>Wito do. So far, youA>Wre all right, Sam. But whatA>Ws the cominA>W program?A>[iiSam hesitated. A>ZI--why, I suppose--I----A>[ Then he had an inspiration.iA>ZLook here, Lon! WhatA>Ws your advice?A>[iiA>ZStick to it!A>[ said Lon emphatically. A>ZHold your crowd up to the mark.iYouA>Wre right; the other fellerA>Ws wrong. HeA>Ws bound to lose in theiend. If things didnA>Wt work out that way in the long run, this oldiworld would A>WaA>W needed a A>VTenants wantedA>W sign back in the time oA>W theicave-men. Fight it out, Sam; fight it out, if it takes all summer!A>[iiA>ZLooks as if it might,A>[ Sam confessed.iiLon dropped a hand on his shoulder. A>ZYou stand to your guns, sonny!iAnd you make your club stand to theirs. Find something to amuse A>Wem,isomething outdoors. IA>Wm great on the open-air treatment.... LetA>Ws see!iIf A>Wtwas vacation, IA>Wd say, go campinA>W. But, say! you can work a schemeisorter in that line, anyhow. Why donA>Wt you turn to and build a shack inithe woods near town? OughtnA>Wt to be too close--let A>Wem have plenty ofiexercise, travelinA>W back and forth.A>[iiSam meditated briefly. A>ZI--well, I do know of that cracking place--outiby the lake. ItA>Ws pretty far, though.A>[iiA>ZThatA>Ws no objection--not for your purpose. Every time you walk A>Wem aimile, thereA>Ws fifteen or twenty minutes used up that wonA>Wt be put intoimopinA>W.

A>ZI donA>Wt care--IA>Wm just aipassenger,A>[ he declared. Orkney at once said yes, and said it heartily.iHerman Boyd was ready for anything. The Shark had no objections toiinterpose. Then Sam sought out Poke, and found him in his barn, withiStep bearing him company.iiIt was not lost upon Sam that when the pair appeared, in answer to hisihail, they took care to close the big door of the barn behind them. Heiplunged at once into his errand, and was a bit disappointed to noteithat neither of the others displayed much enthusiasm.iiA>ZOh, I guess itA>Wll be all right--if you say so,A>[ quoth Poke. A>ZOficourse, weA>Wre awfully busy, and thereA>Ws lots to do, and--er--er--butiyou mostly know what youA>Wre about, Sam.A>[iiA>ZYes, but weA>Wre mighty busy, you know,A>[ contributed Step.iiSam glanced keenly at the pair. The hands of both were grimy, andithere were certain greasy spots on their clothes, which stirred hisicuriosity and reminded him of the mysterious occupation to which theyihad been giving their spare time.iiA>ZWhatA>Ws up?A>[ he demanded. A>ZOut with it!A>[iiPoke glanced at Step, and Step shot an uneasy glance at Poke.iiA>ZOh, if it is something you donA>Wt care to talk about----A>[ Sam began.iiPoke cleared his throat. A>ZAhem, ahem! It--look here, Sam! It is a sortiof a secret, and yet I donA>Wt know why we shouldnA>Wt tell you. Course, weiwouldnA>Wt want it gossiped all over town--we canA>Wt have the crowd comingihere and trying to get a sight of--of IT! But you--why, itA>Ws differentiwith you, you know.A>[iiA>ZAnd heA>Wd have to find out sooner or later, anyway,A>[ said Step, in aistage whisper.iiA>ZHe would--might as well tell him now,A>[ responded Poke. A>ZBut itA>Ws to goino farther,A>[ he added, addressing Sam. A>ZYouA>Wll understand why, when Iitell you.A>[iiA>ZFire ahead!A>[ said Sam. A>ZI canA>Wt say I understand anything yet.A>[iiThere was no outsider in sight, but Poke lowered his voice.iiA>ZYou remember that motor I bought? The one from the smashedimachine--havenA>Wt forgotten it, have you?A>[iiSam had not forgotten the incident of the purchase from Mr. Haskins,ithough he had thought very little about it for some days.iiA>ZWhat! That crazy deal?A>[ he said. A>ZWhatA>Ws your game?A>[iiA>ZYou may call the deal what you please,A>[ said Poke with dignity, A>Zbut IiwonA>Wt admit it was crazy.A>[iiA>ZNever mind that part of it. Go on, go on!A>[ Sam urged. He wasirecalling, not too distinctly, a story somebody had told him of seeingiPoke and Step driving into town with something carefully covered in theiback of their wagon. A>ZGo on, I say! You fished the motor out of theiwreck, didnA>Wt you, and brought it in?A>[iiA>ZI did,A>[ said Poke.iiA>ZWe did,A>[ Step corrected.iiA>ZGot it here?A>[iiA>ZYes,A>[ said Poke and Step together.iiA>ZWell, what are you going to do with it?A>[iiStep started to say something, and changed his mind. The result was aniextraordinary gasp. But Sam understood. Tempted as he was to proclaimigreat news, Step was surrendering that honor to his chum.iiPoke drew a long breath. Then he spoke explosively:iiA>ZFlying machine! WeA>Wre making one!A>[iiThe reception of the sensational tidings should have satisfied PokeA>Wsiyearning for dramatic effects. Sam dropped weakly upon a horse-block,iwhich happened to be conveniently near. He stared at Poke blankly.iiA>ZYou--_youA>Wre_ making a--a flying machine!A>[iiA>ZI am!A>[ Poke declared promptly.iiA>ZWe are,A>[ Step hastened to amend.iiPoke nodded. A>ZSure! ThatA>Ws right. WeA>Wre both in it.A>[iiA>ZBut it was PokeA>Ws idea,A>[ testified Step generously.iiA>ZMaybe, but Step has taken hold like a good fellow and helped a lot,A>[iaverred Poke, not to be outdone in fairness.iiSam waved an impatient hand. A>ZThatA>Ws all right. Tell me about theimachine. What is it? Zeppelin?A>[iiA>ZOf course not!A>[ cried Poke. A>ZZeppelin nothing! ItA>Wll be a plane.A>[iiA>ZMonoplane or biplane?A>[iiA>ZWhy--why, weA>Wre working on two or three plans. WeA>Wll see which worksiout best. They say a monoplane is faster, and a biplane safer. WeihavenA>Wt settled all the details yet.A>[iiA>ZGo ahead! Tell me some more.A>[iiA>ZYes, let him have the whole thing,A>[ Step advised.iiA>ZWell, it was this way,A>[ Poke explained. A>ZYou know that day out by theilake? When Haskins told us about the machine running away with him, heimentioned that it had a mighty high-speed motor--one thatA>Wd do in aiflying machine, he said. That set me thinking.A>[iiA>ZPokeA>Ws a crackerjack when it comes to that sort of thing,A>[ Stepiobserved admiringly.iiPoke modestly disregarded the tribute. A>ZStruck me, Sam, there was myichance. You know IA>Wm in debt to all you fellows----A>[iiA>ZNonsense!A>[ Sam broke in. A>ZWeA>Wve told you to forget it.A>[iiA>ZHowA>Ws a fellow going to forget such things? I couldnA>Wt, if Iiwanted to. And I saw my chance. You know what they pay aviators foriexhibitions at county fairs and such places?A>[iiA>ZNo! Do you?A>[ Sam asked pointedly.iiA>ZYes, sir, I do! Hundred dollars a crack! Read it in a paper.A>[iiA>ZOh!A>[iiA>ZWell, I saw the whole thing in a flash. If I got that high-speedimotor and rigged up a plane, and learned to run it--why, two or threeiexhibitions would pay all my debts and put me on Easy Street. And thinkiof all the fun IA>Wd have! And Step--he--well, minute I suggested it toihim, he saw the whole thing just as clearly as I did.A>[iiA>ZDonA>Wt doubt he did,A>[ said Sam.iiA>ZSo he said heA>Wd take hold and help. He did, and weA>Wre workingitogether. HeA>Wll be entitled to a full share in the credit.A>[iiA>ZExcept for inventing the idea, to begin with,A>[ Step corrected.iiA>ZOh, thereA>Wll be glory enough for all,A>[ said Poke easily.iiSam coughed. A>ZH-g-h! I--I guess I understand. Say, though! Your folksiknow about all this?A>[iiA>ZThey know weA>Wre doing something in the barn. And they donA>Wt care.A>[iiA>ZSaid so, have they?A>[iiA>ZWell, not--not exactly. But they havenA>Wt tried to stop us. We donA>Wtikeep a horse now, you know, so they donA>Wt have to come out this wayioften. But they wouldnA>Wt mind, anyway.A>[iiSam did not press the point. A>ZLook here, Poke!A>[ said he. A>ZI donA>Wtiknow much about flying machines, but the little I know makes me thinkitheyA>Wve got to be all right, or theyA>Wll be all wrong. So, unless youiunderstand how to build A>Wem----A>[iiA>ZBut I do! Saw an article in a magazine and saved it. ItA>Ws just full ofidiagrams and dimensions and all that sort of thing.A>[iiA>ZBut there must be problems of weights to be lifted--engine weight,iyour weight, and so on. And youA>Wve got to figure out the size of theiplanes to suit the load and the power.A>[iiPoke waved a lordly hand. A>ZHumph! DonA>Wt you suppose I know that? AndidonA>Wt you suppose IA>Wm looking out for such details? Well, I am! Youitrust your Uncle Dudley to be crafty in a thing like this!A>[iiA>ZBut----A>[ Sam began; then checked his speech. It was clear that Pokeiand Step were committed to their amazing enterprise. On the strength ofilong acquaintance with the pair he had no doubt that somehow or otherithey would contrive to come to grief; but he failed to see that thereiwas anything he could do about it. Moreover, there were certain presentiadvantages to the Safety First Club in having two of its members soithoroughly occupied.iiPoke wagged his head sagely. A>ZDonA>Wt think, Sam, that IA>Wm going intoithis thing blindfolded. ItA>Ws a scientific scheme, and IA>Wm putting itithrough scientifically. Just you wait and see!A>[iiA>ZAll right--IA>Wll wait. But isnA>Wt there anything to see yet?A>[iiThe others exchanged glances.iiA>ZWhy--why, no,A>[ said Poke. A>ZYou can come in and take a look. Of course,iweA>Wre messed up, but maybe you can get an idea of what weA>Wre at.A>[iiSam followed him into the barn. Because doors were kept closed andihorse blankets had been hung at windows to preserve secrecy, the placeiwas somewhat dim; but he made out the motor, set upon a pair of woodenihorses, with a confusion of wrenches and other tools about it. In theibackground was a gaunt framework of bamboo poles and wire.iiA>ZFor the planes,A>[ Poke explained. A>ZWeA>Wre still experimenting. But weA>Wreigetting there; we learn something every day.A>[iiSam made observation as closely as he could, but without greatienlightenment.iiA>ZWell, live and learn,A>[ he remarked, non-committally. A>ZAnd when do youiexpect to have the--er--er--the thing finished?A>[iiA>ZOh, pretty soon,A>[ Poke told him. A>ZWeA>Wre getting along faster thaniyouA>Wd think. Step is a star at a job like this.A>[iiA>ZWell, I do seem to be able to work out PokeA>Ws ideas when he canA>Wt doiit himself,A>[ Step admitted.iiSam cleared his throat. A>ZAhem, ahem! I--well, I guess my opinion isnA>Wtiof much value, anyway. But thereA>Ws something else I want to talk aboutiwith you fellows. Now, listen!A>[ And he repeated, rapidly but clearly,ithe project for a camp near the lake.iiStep did not appear to be impressed, but Poke was more responsive.iiA>ZGreat scheme, Sam! Good sport! Besides, itA>Wll give us a chance to haveithe try-outs with the machine without a whole parcel of folks lookingion and yawping. Those open fields this side of the woods by the lakeiwill be a bully place--nice and private and plenty of elbow room. Say,iIA>Wm with you!A>[iiA>ZThen I am, too, of course,A>[ said Step. A>ZWhenA>Wll you start in?A>[iiA>ZVery soon,A>[ Sam told him.iiPoke furrowed his brow. A>ZSay, IA>Wm afraid we wonA>Wt be able to help muchiat first; weA>Wll be busy here, you know. But a little later----A>[iiA>ZOh, thatA>Wll be all right,A>[ Sam hastened to assure him. A>ZThe mainithingA>Ws to keep the club together.A>[iiA>ZSure!A>[ said the others in chorus.iiA>ZAnd thatA>Ws always the main thing,A>[ Poke added heartily.iiiiiCHAPTER X SAM REJECTS A PROFFERED OLIVE BRANCHiiiOf a Saturday, bright and early, Sam and his followers set out forithe lake. Only Poke and Step were missing, both having pleaded theiriexceedingly pressing duties as constructors of a flying machine, andihaving agreed, readily enough, to endorse the othersA>W choice of a siteifor the camp. The Trojan was in the party, hardly as a volunteer andiyet making no objection. The Shark marched along with his usual air ofiindifference, but Tom Orkney and Herman Boyd, who had some inkling ofiSamA>Ws real problem and his efforts to solve it, showed both interestiand enthusiasm.iiLon had suggested a willingness to carry the club to the lake in theibig car, but Sam had preferred a hike, it being his first care toikeep his chums occupied. The day was fine, the sky clear, and theimorning air fresh and invigorating. The single drawback was the dustiin the road. There had been no rain for several weeks, and thoughithe conditions did not yet approach those of a drought, farmers andigardeners were beginning to predict crop failures, unless a change cameiin the weather. To the boys, however, this danger did not make specialiappeal; and as the brightness of the spring foliage had not faded, theyideemed it a very pleasant day, indeed, and marched along at a briskipace.iiOn the way there was more or less discussion of the charms of the lakeidistrict, and the rival advantages of the two shores. Herman had aitheory that it might be well to establish themselves near the pleasureiresort--not too near, of course, but near enough to hear the band wheniit played. Orkney was strongly for the greater privacy of the otheriside of the lake. The Trojan and the Shark expressed no preference, andiSam withheld his ideas on the subject.iiA>ZWeA>Wll scout all around,A>[ he said. A>ZThen we can pick the best spot.iWeA>Wve plenty of time to make the right choice.A>[iiNow, scouting was a somewhat leisurely performance, and not a bad wayiof passing several hours. The country about the lake was rolling,iwith a great deal of woodland--largely A>Zsecond growthA>[ hardwood, as isifrequently the case when a pine and spruce country has been lumbered,iand birches, oaks and maples come in to take the places of the fallenigiants of the forest. In this case the lumbering had taken place soilong ago that the new trees had attained considerable size, though theiA>ZslashA>[ left by the cutting (the litter of tops, limbs and broken treesinot worth removal) was still much in evidence, offering dangerouslyiinflammable material, should a fire ever get a fair start in theitract. Here and there, in the low spots between the ridges and littleihills, the boys found swampy areas, where the undergrowth was thickiand tangled enough to suggest a jungle. On the side where the pavilioniand cottages were in course of erection something had been done inithe way of clearing away the woods rubbish, but the club was agreedithat the opposite shore had more natural advantages. Even Herman cameiover to this view at the consultation following luncheon; and thereiwas unanimity of opinion that the best site for a camp would be in theineighborhood of the big Council Rock. Within fifty yards of the greatistone was a glade where a tent could be pitched or a shack built; theispring not far away was clear and bubbling; and, finally, between theiwoods and the road was an open field where Poke and Step could man$Quveriwith their flying machine.iiSam did not feel at liberty to explain to the others the remarkableienterprise in which the pair were engaged, feeling that divulging theigreat secret was the privilege of the young inventors; but in the talkihe laid stress on the advantages of having open ground near by. To thisisuggestion there was ready agreement. A chance for scrub baseball gamesiappealed to everybody, except perhaps the Shark; there might be evenipossibilities of tennis. In the case of the after-luncheon discussionithe club was prepared to admit that a generally more promising placeifor a camp hardly could be desired.iiSam, with Poke and StepA>Ws undertaking in mind, strolled away fromithe group to study the fields with more care; and he was gazingithoughtfully at the expanse of turf, when he heard a step behindihim, and turned to see the Shark coming up. The spectacled youthisaid nothing, but halted beside Sam and surveyed the open groundideliberately.iiA>ZHow big is it--how many acres?A>[ Sam asked, after a little. With theiclub it had come to be a habit to turn all calculations over to theiShark, as belonging in his special province.iiA>ZHuh! What do you mean?A>[ the Shark countered.iiSam waved a hand in a sweeping gesture. A>ZWhy, all that--out there. Howimuch room is there?A>[iiA>ZClear ground or space within the fences?A>[iiA>ZClear ground.A>[iiA>ZTen acres, plus.A>[iiA>ZOh!A>[ said Sam. A>ZThatA>Ws quite a lot.A>[iiA>ZHuh!A>[iiThere was an odd note in the SharkA>Ws tone. Sam glanced at him keenly;isuspicion seized him that the other might have an inkling of what wasiin his mind.iiA>ZI--IA>Wm wondering if thereA>Ws room for--well, for something,A>[ he saidisuggestively.iiThe Shark grunted. A>ZUmph! SoA>Wm IA>[; turned; stalked away. Sam chuckled.iHis suspicion was strengthened, but his liking for the Shark was notilessened. Plainly that youth could keep a secret with the best of them.iiSam strolled on, crossing the field and coming to the road. Thereihe paused for a little. A wagon loaded high with boards for the newibuildings went creaking by; a farmer jogged along on his way back fromitown; then a touring automobile, with much luggage in its tonneau, spediby, raising a great cloud of dust. Plainly, there was a good deal ofitraffic, of one sort or another, but Sam reflected comfortably that theicamp would be far enough from the highway to escape its bustle.iiHe was about to turn back, when the sharp bark of a motorcycle caughtihis ear, and in a moment more the machine shot around a bend in theiroad. It was traveling at a great pace, which slackened quickly whenithe rider caught sight of the figure by the roadside. Sam could notirepress a start of surprise. His eyes were good, and in spite of theisemi-disguise of goggles and low-drawn cap he recognized Zorn, even asihe perceived that the traveler intended to halt for parley.iiZorn stopped his machine abreast of Sam, hopped nimbly from his saddle,iand dropped the support by which it could be held upright. He pushediback his cap and pulled off his goggles.iiA>ZParker, this is lucky,A>[ he said. A>ZIA>Wve been wanting a chance to talkithings over with you, when weA>Wd be nice and private with nobody toirubber.A>[iiSam met the overture coldly. A>ZI donA>Wt know that I want to talk to you.A>[iiZorn grinned. A>ZWell, you canA>Wt very well help yourself--unless you runiaway.A>[iiA>ZOh, IA>Wve things enough to say,A>[ Sam responded sharply. A>ZIA>Wve just beeniwaiting for the right time.A>[iiA>ZDonA>Wt worry--this is it! NeverA>Wll be a better time or place for whatiyouA>Wre going to hear.... Look here! Had enough, have you?A>[iiSam stared at the other. A>ZEnough? What are you driving at?A>[iiA>ZYou oughtnA>Wt to need maps. That election the other day proved that youiand your gang are done for--unless I lend you a hand.A>[iiA>ZWhat kind of a hand?A>[iiZorn showed his teeth, though his speech was pacific. A>ZA helping hand.iYouA>Wre in bad--the lot of you.A>[iiA>ZOh! Are we?A>[iiA>ZYou are. The whole school believes youA>Wre a crowd of cheats anditattletales.A>[iiSam kept his temper, and that he did so was proof of the disciplineihe had had in self-mastery. Moreover, it had flashed upon him that itiwas his business to learn, so far as he might, the purpose of Zorniin the campaign he had waged against the club. Purely as a matter ofipreference he would have chosen to resort then and there to violence,ibut a fight would cut short the explanation he so greatly desired. Soihe said, quietly enough:iiA>ZThereA>Ws no truth in it. Nobody knows that better than you do.A>[iiA>ZI know you gave Walker away.A>[iiA>ZI had no such intention.A>[iiA>ZAnd heA>Ws under sentence for breaking rules and then lying about whatiheA>Wd done.A>[iiA>ZWalker neither broke rules nor lied.A>[iiZorn shrugged contemptuously. A>ZOh, whatA>Ws the use, Parker? You can singithat song till youA>Wre black in the face, and itA>Wll do you no good.iYouA>Wre in a hole, and you canA>Wt get yourself or your crowd out. YouA>Wveigot to have the helping hand, I tell you, and IA>Wm the only fellow whoican extend it to you.A>[iiA>ZMeaning that as you started all the lies about us, nobody but you canistop A>Wem?A>[iiAt that Zorn scowled. A>ZSee here, Parker! IA>Wm not fussy, but if weA>Wreito do business, youA>Wd better keep a civil tongue in your head. Cut outithe A>VlieA>W foolishness! This thing didnA>Wt require lying. You and Walkerimanaged to mess things so, the plain record convicts you.A>[iiA>ZThe record, as you call it, is wrong, mistaken.A>[iiA>ZWhat if it is? It stands till itA>Ws disproved. And whoA>Ws going toidisprove it? You canA>Wt.A>[iiA>ZCan you?A>[ Sam shot back at him.iiA>ZSure I can,A>[ said Zorn coolly.iiA>ZThen why donA>Wt you?A>[iiA>ZWhy should I? What have you or your push ever done for me?A>[iiSam checked the hot speech that trembled on his lips. A>ZWait a minute,iZorn,A>[ he said. A>ZLet me get this straight. It sounds as if you wantedito strike a bargain. Is that the idea?A>[iiA>ZTo a dot! Fine! YouA>Wre waking up!A>[iiA>ZAnd if we do something for you, youA>Wll clear the record for us?iYouA>Wll go to all the people youA>Wve told your story to, and youA>Wllitake it back? YouA>Wll straighten out things for Trojan Walker with theiprincipal? YouA>Wll tell who did the mean work, who took that book intoithe examination, who----A>[iiZorn stopped him. A>ZPull up, Parker! Suppose there was crookediwork--suppose there wasnA>Wt--suppose all the trouble came from a queeriaccident. IA>Wm not saying which it was. All I am saying is that I canifix your crowd and fix A>Wem right--clean the slate for A>Wem--all that.iWill you be sensible and make a trade?A>[iiA>ZWhat kind of a trade?A>[iiZorn took a step nearer Sam, who was standing on the outer bank of theinarrow roadside ditch. The movement brought the two boys very closeitogether.iiA>ZThis is straight talk--understand? I mean business.A>[iiA>ZAll right,A>[ said Sam. A>ZGo on!A>[iiA>ZIA>Wll see the slateA>Ws cleaned for you and your crowd, if----A>[iiA>ZIf what?A>[iiA>ZIf youA>Wll do what I want you to do.A>[iiA>ZAnd whatA>Ws that?A>[iiA>ZBack me up. IA>Wve got some plans. You can help me--you and your gang.iYou can help me a lot.A>[iiA>ZHow?A>[ Sam shot the query at Zorn.iiZornA>Ws answer was prompt enough; plainly, he had his ideas clearlyiformulated.iiA>ZThe way to get a thing is to make up your mind just what you want andithen go for it. Now, I want to be boss of the class and of the schoolinext year--I donA>Wt make any bones about it--to you.A>[iiSam smiled, a little grimly. A>ZGo on,A>[ he said.iiA>ZTo be boss, IA>Wve got to have backing. I need yours--and by yours Iimean your whole clubA>Ws.A>[iiA>ZBacking for what?A>[iiA>ZWell, to begin with, thereA>Ws the meeting to form a County Inter-SchooliAthletic Association. One Junior will be on our schoolA>Ws committee.iIA>Wm after that job, and I want a practically unanimous election by theiclass. I can have it, if your crowd will swing into line. Then, thereA>Wsitalk of a school athletic council next year. If I land one, I can landithe other, too. Then thereA>Ws the Valley Debating League. It hasnA>Wtiamounted to much lately, but I can get hold of it, and build it up.iAnd there are some other things--never mind them now, though; theyA>Wllinaturally follow the others.A>[iiSam stared at Zorn; there was more than a trace of amazement in hisiexpression.iiA>ZWhew! but youA>Wre scheming to be a regular Pooh-Bah! You want to be theiwhole thing!A>[iiZorn nodded coolly. A>ZThatA>Ws the ticket, Parker. No use pretendingianything else. But there isnA>Wt a thing IA>Wve mentioned that I canA>Wtihave, if your club will play my game. I take off my hat to you forithe way you hold your bunch together. WhatA>Ws more, I know perfectlyiwell that youA>Wve got a lot of influence in the class--and I want thatiinfluence. YouA>Wre kind of down and out now, but, as IA>Wve told you, Iican put the lot of you back on your feet. ThatA>Ws worth something, isnA>Wtiit?A>[iiA>ZYes,A>[ said Sam quietly.iiZorn grinned. A>ZGood! Now weA>Wre coming down to business.A>[iiA fine line showed in SamA>Ws forehead. A>ZZorn, this means you want toitrade on the fact you can clear the Trojan of charges of which heiisnA>Wt guilty.A>[iiA>ZThe Trojan and you, too. TheyA>Wre more down on you--the class, Iimean--theyA>Wre sorer on you, Parker, than they are on Walker.A>[iiA>ZBecause of the lies--no; IA>Wll call them reports--youA>Wve spread?A>[iiA>ZThatA>Ws better.A>[iiA>ZThen you own up you did make all the trouble? Just what did you telliabout us?A>[iiA>ZNever mind what I said. It was enough--and not too much.A>[iiA>ZAnd you can say enough more to straighten everything out?A>[iiA>ZThatA>Ws right--youA>Wve got the combination.A>[iiA>ZWhat will you say?A>[iiA>ZYouA>Wll find out--the day you vote as I tell you to.A>[iiSamA>Ws expression was growing more belligerent. A>ZZorn, youA>Wre aimiserable skunk, but youA>Wve trapped yourself. YouA>Wve owned up youipractically lied about us. When I tell that to folks----A>[iiA>ZTell, and be hanged! What good will it do you? NobodyA>Wll believe you!A>[iiA>ZBut you said it!A>[iiAt that Zorn laughed. A>ZHo, ho! Parker, youA>Wre a mark, youA>Wre easy!iWhereA>Wll be your witnesses?A>[iiA>ZYou mean, youA>Wll deny it?A>[iiA>ZSure! ThatA>Ws the advantage of having nobody else around when youA>Wreitalking confidentially.A>[iiSam gasped. Here was a standard of conduct which was new to him.iA>ZYou--you----A>[iiA>ZOh, I wasnA>Wt born yesterday,A>[ Zorn interposed. A>ZI know when to makeispeeches to a crowd, and when to take A>Wem one at a time. Nobody hasiheard what IA>Wve told you to-day; you canA>Wt bring witnesses. My word isias good as yours--no; better. I havenA>Wt got the school down on me. ButithatA>Ws not the first question, which is, will you do business?A>[iiA>ZNo--not that sort of business!A>[ Sam cried wrathfully.iiZorn scowled. A>ZYouA>Wre an idiot, then. I offer you a chance to getiyourself and your crowd in right again, and you wonA>Wt have it, eh? Whatido you want? What do you propose to do?A>[iiA>ZThrash you!A>[ said Sam promptly. A>ZThereA>Ws a licking coming to you,iZorn, and after what youA>Wve said to-day, itA>Ws time you had it.A>[iiZorn laughed scornfully. A>ZGuess IA>Wll have something more to say aboutithat, Parker. The fellow that can whip me doesnA>Wt wear your shoes.A>[ii[Illustration: SAM BEGAN TO WRIGGLE OUT OF HIS JACKET]iiSam began to wriggle out of his jacket. A>ZYou wait a minute, and weA>Wllisee about that!A>[ he said curtly.iiBut Zorn didnA>Wt wait. There was a second in which Sam, with his armsistill held by the sleeves of his half-removed coat, was helplessiagainst attack. Zorn improved the chance, though by the schoolboyicode he was violating all the principles of fair play. He struck Samia vicious blow on the forehead. Under the impact Sam reeled; lost hisifooting; slipped down the bank of the ditch, and measured his lengthion the ground. As he struggled to his feet, and completed the task ofifreeing himself from his coat, Zorn, who had sprung to his machine andistarted his motor, was out of reach and retreating at speed.iiSam shouted a challenge to him to halt and accept combat. It isidoubtful if Zorn heard his voice above the bark of the motor, but atithat instant he turned in his saddle and waved a derisive farewell.iiiiiCHAPTER XI SAM HEARS OF THE SARACENiiiSam laid before his friends the story of ZornA>Ws curious proposal,ibut said nothing of the manner of his parting with the adversary.iNot that he was disposed to forget the treacherous blow; indeed, hisidetermination some day to visit physical retribution upon the otheriwas stronger than ever, but he felt that there were more importantiand pressing questions to be answered before he could dispose of hisipersonal feud with Zorn.iiThe offer made by Zorn puzzled the clan. How could he clean theislate, as he had said? How could he establish, to the satisfactioniof the faculty, that the Trojan had not broken the rules? How couldihe persuade the school that Sam had not been an intentional witnessiagainst Walker? The club held long and serious debate on these matters.iStep was of opinion that Zorn was acting in bad faith, and cared onlyito secure the support of the club. This obtained, he would simply notiattempt to carry out his agreement.iiA>ZWhy, heA>Wd just snap his fingers at us and laugh in our faces,A>[ Stepiinsisted. A>ZWhen we kicked, heA>Wd call us easy marks and ask us what weiwere going to do about it. But if it ever comes to a vote, count meiagainst Ed Zorn, first, last and all the time.A>[iiPoke agreed with his chum. Zorn was bluffing, he argued. Herman Boydiappeared to be less certain that Zorn could do nothing to make good hisioffer, but was no more disposed than were the others to accept it. TheiShark shrugged his shoulders.iiA>ZHow can you figure this out?A>[ he growled. A>ZNo known quantities! Alliguesswork and say-so!A>[iiThe Trojan, who logically might have been expected to display mostiinterest in the proposal, was indifferent. The feeling that he had beenitreated with gross unfairness was still strong with him, and made himibitter to a degree which sometimes taxed even SamA>Ws patience.iiOrkney had little to say; but, as Sam observed, was not inclinedito regard Zorn as unable to carry out his proposal. Questioned iniprivate, Tom confessed a good deal of appreciation of ZornA>Ws capacityifor mischief.iiA>ZIA>Wve been picking up what I could about the stories that have beenispread about the school,A>[ Orkney explained, A>Zand theyA>Wre corkers, alliright! I donA>Wt wonder weA>Wre in bad. About one part truth and nine partsifake--thatA>Ws the way with them. But the grain of fact seems to save theimass of falsehood. And theyA>Wre clever and ingenious--thatA>Ws what makesiit so hard to try to disprove them. So IA>Wm sure Zorn is at the bottomiof the row, and just as sure that he knows what he is about, and hasisome definite scheme he is following out. And if part of that schemeicalls for undoing what heA>Ws done--why, heA>Ws the one fellow who can undoiit.A>[iiA>ZBut how?A>[ Sam queried.iiOrkney shook his head. A>ZI donA>Wt know. Mind you, he took care not toigive you a line on his method. He said, didnA>Wt he, that all the troubleimight have come from a A>Vqueer accidentA>W or from A>Vcrooked workA>W--heiwasnA>Wt saying which it was? Well, then! What he meant was that weA>Wdihave to deal with his offer blindfolded, as it were, and trust to hisiword. He was taking pains not to give you any more information than heihad to give. It all fits in with the rest of his performance.A>[iiA>ZBut youA>Wre not for taking up with him?A>[iiA>ZNot on your life!A>[ said Tom curtly. A>ZWeA>Wll beat him yet, and weA>Wllibeat him without any low-down deals.A>[iiSam nodded. A>ZThatA>Ws my notion, too. Clever as he is, heA>Wll make someifalse step, or a breakA>Wll come somewhere. You canA>Wt beat the truth inithe long run.A>[iiA>ZYouA>Wve said it!A>[ Orkney agreed with conviction.iiSam laughed. A>ZBut Lon said it first,A>[ he remarked.iiFor all the boys it was a relief to turn from plots and intrigues toithe good sport of planning and building the camp. Possibly the plansiwere more entertaining than their execution. Poke and Step left detailsito the others, who put their heads together and discussed the rivalimerits of a tent and a shack, and finally sought LonA>Ws advice.iiLon, as it proved, favored a tent.iiA>ZYou see, boys, youA>Wre more or less transients,A>[ he explained. A>ZNow,ithereA>Wll be some things thatA>Wll be like the mumps--you canA>Wt tell howimuch theyA>Wll bother till youA>Wve had a go with A>Wem. Take the A>Wskeeters,ifor instance. The old pond used to have a sight of A>Wem, and you donA>Wtiknow whether theyA>Wve moved out jest because itA>Ws been turned into ailake. Then thereA>Ws the fishinA>W. It used to be prime off the big rock,ibut fish are notional as folks, and as freaky. Then, too, thereA>Ws theipermission to use the land--who owns that shore, anyway?A>[iiNone of the club could answer the question.iiA>ZWell, youA>Wd better find out,A>[ Lon counseled. A>ZCourse, in the oldidays, if you wanted to put in a week or so in the woods, it was a caseiof move in and welcome, so longA>Ws you behaved and didnA>Wt cut growinA>Witimber, and didnA>Wt start forest fires----By the way, boys, thatA>Ws aithing youA>Wll have to be careful about; itA>Ws gettinA>W powerful tinderyiin the woods this dry spell. But nowadays weA>Wre gettinA>W fashionable,iand theyA>Wre cuttinA>W up lots along the lake shore, and owners may beifussy. So, seems to me I wouldnA>Wt be making many permanent improvementsianywhere till I found out whether I was goinA>W to be allowed to enjoyithe use and usufruct oA>W the same.... Two dollars, please!A>[iiA>ZWhat for?A>[ the boys chorused.iiA>ZMy fee for legal advice!A>[ Lon chuckled. A>ZRegA>Wlar office rate, ainA>Wtiit? Settle up!A>[iiA>ZGuess youA>Wll have to charge it,A>[ Sam told him.iiA>ZCanA>Wt do that, but IA>Wll drop out to the camp when youA>Wre settled, anditake it out in board and lodginA>Ws.A>[iiA>ZThatA>Ws all right,A>[ Sam declared. A>ZBut weA>Wll want to have you along,ianyway.A>[iiA>ZThen find out whose land youA>Wre on, and get his permission. I allersidid hate to be waked up at midnight and told to move on because I wasitrespassinA>W.A>[iiA>ZWeA>Wll attend to it,A>[ Sam said. It was good and sensible advice, and heimeant to improve it; but, as it chanced, there was a difficulty in theiway. Division lines in wooded tracts are often very faintly indicated;ieven neighborsA>W ideas on the subject are vague. Sam made inquiries;ifailed to gain light; discovered nobody who offered objections, andicame to the conclusion that a tent pitched near the big rock was notilikely to lead to protest.iiTom Orkney had an old tent, somewhat in need of patches and repairs;iHerman Boyd produced the remnants of one still older but furnishingimaterial for strengthening the other. The club massed its strength foricutting and sewing, fitting fresh guy ropes and providing pegs. Thenione afternoon Lon announced himself ready to transport the equipment toithe lake, and Sam started out to round up his clan.iiOrkney, the Trojan and Herman were reached by telephone, but the Sharkiwas not at home. Sam, descending upon the airship builders, found himiin consultation with Poke and Step. PokeA>Ws barn was more than ever likeia cavern of mystery. The blankets at the windows were drawn back forithe sake of better light for the workers, but the confusion of tools,icans, motor parts and wire had multiplied since SamA>Ws former visit. Inithe midst of it all loomed the framework of the wings.iiSam peered at the machine with lively curiosity.iiA>ZHulloo! Going to make it a monoplane, are you?A>[ said he. A>ZWhen I wasihere before you hadnA>Wt decided.A>[iiPoke coughed, and glanced a bit nervously at the Shark. A>ZAhem!iWhy--why, Sam, I guess the monoplane will work better, seeing theikind of motor weA>Wve got--high speed kind, you know. And the Shark--heisays----A>[iiThe Shark emitted a sound. It was not a groan, nor a grunt, nor yet aichuckle; but, somehow, it suggested all three. Sam turned to him.iiA>ZThe other day I guessed you knew something about this, though you keptiyour own counsel--that day we were looking over the open field near theilake.A>[iiA>ZUmph! Then you guessed right.A>[iiA>ZWhat do you think of the scheme?A>[iiA>ZCrazy!A>[ snapped the Shark.iiThere Poke intervened. A>ZLet me explain, Sam! IA>Wm not crazy, and theischeme isnA>Wt crazy. ThereA>Ws a lot of mathematics in flying. ThatA>Ws whyiI called in the Shark to figure out things for me. If anybody can doiit, he can. Now, you see, flying is just lifting a load in the air andimoving ahead. To do that youA>Wve got to apply power to a propeller. IA>Wveitold the Shark to calculate how many revolutions a minute the propellerihas got to make to do the business for us, and what the plane spaceishould be, and a few other little things like that.A>[iiA>ZYes, thatA>Ws all he wants me to tell him!A>[ jeered the Shark.iiA>ZWell, thatA>Ws why brains like yours are put in anybodyA>Ws head,A>[ quothiPoke, philosophically.iiA>ZAs if IA>Wd ever specialized on aeronautics! Why, IA>Wve got to dig theiwhole thing out!A>[iiA>ZThen you havenA>Wt given your opinion yet?A>[ Sam asked.iiA>ZOf course not!A>[ cried the Shark; then he grinned. A>ZI did tell Poke oneithing, though. I showed him heA>Wd made his first design of a plane soiwide he couldnA>Wt get the contraption through the barn door, no matterihow he turned it.A>[iiPokeA>Ws face grew a rosy red. A>ZOh, that! Well, I guess we did makeia little miscalculation. But it didnA>Wt matter. All weA>Wve got to doiis to make up for reduced plane area by increasing the speed of theimachine--speeding up the propeller and engine, you know.A>[iiA>ZI donA>Wt know,A>[ said Sam. A>ZIA>Wll have to take your word for it.A>[iiA>ZWell, IA>Wm right about it. You see, the faster we fly, the bigger theilift. IA>Wve read that, and itA>Ws plain as the nose of your face, anyway.A>[iiSam looked his doubts. A>ZI should think there might be trouble iniincreasing the power indefinitely.A>[iiA>ZOh, StepA>Ws worked out a plan--have the propeller turn three times,isay, instead of two for every revolution of the engine--thatA>Ws theiidea. I donA>Wt know just the ratio--IA>Wm leaving it to Step and theiShark. But itA>Wll be all right. The SharkA>Ws a wizard for figuring, andiStepA>Ws a cracker jack on the mechanical end!A>[iiA>ZWell, youA>Wve got to do the best you can with things,A>[ remarked Stepicomplacently.iiSam glanced at the motor. A>ZHowA>Ws the wreck working?A>[ he inquired.iiA>ZBully!A>[ said Step.iiA>ZPretty well,A>[ was PokeA>Ws verdict.iiA>ZYou donA>Wt agree very closely,A>[ Sam commented.iiA>ZOh, well, maybe she skips now and then,A>[ Step admitted. A>ZBut I--we,ithat is--weA>Wll have her humming like a top before long.A>[iiA>ZYes, StepA>Wll attend to that part of it,A>[ said Poke confidently.iiThe Shark appeared to be tiring of the discussion; for he turned to theidoor. Reminded of the afternoonA>Ws business, Sam stopped him.iiA>ZLonA>Ws all ready to take us out to the lake. WeA>Wll pitch camp beforeinight.A>[iiA>ZAll right! IA>Wll go along,A>[ said the Shark readily.iiA>ZYou, too, Poke?A>[iiPoke and Step exchanged glances; then said the former, with a trace ofireluctance:iiA>ZWhy--why, I guess so. Course weA>Wve got lots to do, but we want to holdiup our end with the rest of the club. So weA>Wll come along, and let theiSaracen wait a while.A>[iiA>ZThe Saracen?A>[ Sam repeated.iiA>ZConfound it, Poke! CanA>Wt you keep anything to yourself?A>[ Step criedireproachfully.iiA>ZOh, that just slipped out!A>[ Poke said ruefully. A>ZI didnA>Wt mean to giveiit away. But A>VSaracenA>W is going to be the name of the machine. Kindiof appropriate, donA>Wt you think? You know you always picture Saracensiskimming around over deserts and--er--er--over things generally. AndithatA>Wll be the way weA>Wll do. Understand?A>[iiA>ZI do,A>[ Sam assured him with all the gravity he could command.iiPokeA>Ws expression betrayed relief. A>ZI thought you would--youA>Wve gotiall-A>Wround brains, Sam. The Shark, now--course heA>Ws got brains, of aisort--and mighty good ones of a sort they are--but while heA>Ws a corkeriat figuring, he canA>Wt seem to rise to the--to the--well, to the romanceiand poetry of a thing like this.A>[iiThe Shark shrugged. A>ZIA>Wd be stronger for this Saracen business, maybe,iif there was a desert or two handy.A>[iiSam was enjoying the conversation, but time was slipping away. Heijoined the Shark by the door.iiA>ZYou fellowsA>Wd better hurry up,A>[ he said to Poke and Step. A>ZCome overito the house. Lon and the car will be waiting.A>[iiA>ZAll right! WeA>Wll come,A>[ they answered together; and Sam, taking theiSharkA>Ws arm, marched him off.iiiiiCHAPTER XII CONCERNING TROUT AND OTHER THINGSiiiThe boys of the club stretched themselves out, very much at theiriease, with the glowing embers of a camp-fire in the center of theiricircle. The tent was pitched and made securely fast to well-drivenipegs; a ditch was dug about it to take care of surplus water in caseiof a rain; in one corner was a shake-down of spruce boughs, artfullyiinterwoven into a thick, elastic mattress, which promised a restful bediin case any of the party chose to remain over night in camp. Poke hadispent two hours in bringing stones from the lake shore and buildingia fireplace to his satisfaction. Orkney had cleared a path from theiglade to the beach. The Trojan and Herman Boyd had stacked a noble pileiof fire-wood. Indeed, everybody had been remarkably busy through theiafternoon, and had brought a wonderful appetite to supper, when lunchibaskets were unpacked, and a coffee-pot sent forth delicious odors toimingle with those others which come only from bacon frying to a turn iniskilful open air cookery. And then there had been the trout! But thatiwas almost a story by itself.iiSam had wondered a bit that Lon, instead of aiding in the work,idisappeared soon after the party reached its destination. And Lon wasigone for hours. He came back, with a rod (cut from a thicket) overihis shoulder and a string of trout, at sight of which the boys raisedia shout. They rained inquiries upon him. How many had he caught?iWhere had he found them? Would he show them the brooks? Trout, be itiunderstood, were much sought by anglers thereabouts, and such a A>ZmessA>[ias Lon had caught was a rarity. But Lon, though much importuned, merelyishook his head and laughed. HeA>Wd caught his trout A>Zover there,A>[ heisaid, giving the boys the traditional answer of the lucky fisherman.iWould he guide them to the brooks? That depended. HeA>Wd see--some day,iperhaps--meanwhile, here were some fine fish to be cooked and eatenibefore they lost their freshness. And as for the cooking--well, Lonicalled attention to the fortunate chance that he had brought along aispecial frying-pan, and a piece of pork, and some meal; and modestlyiremarked that he was something of a chef himself when it came toidealing with trout just out of their native waters. As he more thanimade good his statement, it was a very toothsome as well as a veryimerry supper to which the club gave its undivided attention.iiThen came the leisurely hour about the fire. In the early twilight ofithe long spring day, when the shadows were thickening under the treesiand the air was taking a hint of crispness, it was good to draw closeito the glowing bed of coals and snuggling comfortably in jacket orisweater, chat lightly of the dayA>Ws incidents and plan improvements inithe camp and expeditions about the surrounding country. Lon, with hisiback against a stump, was a picture of contentment.iiA>ZTell you, boys, this is the life!A>[ he said. A>ZIA>Wd live it all theiwhile, if A>WtwaA>WnA>Wt for jest one little drawback.A>[iiA>ZWhatA>Ws that, Lon?A>[ Step demanded.iiA>ZThe need oA>W gettinA>W three square meals a day. Somehow, my constitutioniseems to require A>Wem. ItA>Ws funny, but A>Wlong about seven in theimorninA>W, and again at noon, and once more near sundown I begin toiget that gone feelinA>W under the belt. And when it comes to supplyinA>Wivictuals regA>Wlar, the woods ainA>Wt in it with what us poets call theihaunts oA>W man. ItA>Ws a pity itA>Ws true, as we say in rhyme.A>[iiA>ZBut that isnA>Wt a rhyme.A>[iiA>ZItA>Ws part of one, anyhow. DonA>Wt expect me to give you a wholeirecitation, do you?A>[iiA>ZIA>Wd rather hear where you caught those trout.A>[iiA>ZThatA>Ws tellinA>W.A>[iiA>ZOh, well, IA>Wve seen bigger ones,A>[ said Sam mischievously.iiA>ZHumph! soA>Wve I,A>[ Lon agreed placidly.iiA>ZMy uncle got a two-and-a-half-pounder once--I saw it,A>[ Pokeicontributed.iiA>ZSquare-tail?A>[ asked Herman.iiA>ZSure!A>[iiA>ZThen it had run into some pond.A>[iiA>ZNo; he caught it in a brook.A>[iiA>ZIA>Wve heard of them as big as that,A>[ said the Trojan.iiA>ZFellow last year was showing one that was over three pounds--brookitrout, too,A>[ declared Step.iiTom Orkney shook his head. A>ZI know, I know! You hear such yarns, but,isomehow, the proof isnA>Wt conclusive. And if youA>Wre talking about theigenuine native trout, and not about some of the imported varieties thatihave been used to stock the streams----A>[iiThere he was interrupted by two or three, speaking at once. A>ZI telliyou those big fellows are pond fish!A>[ A>ZThe nativeA>Ws the best of theilot, but he wonA>Wt grow so big!A>[ A>ZItA>Ws all a question of food supply--myifather says so!A>[iiTom chose to accept none of the challenges. Instead, he turned to Lon.iiA>ZLook here! YouA>Wve fished all the streams around here. What do you sayiabout it?A>[iiA>ZI ainA>Wt sayinA>W, son. I ainA>Wt quite sure whatA>Ws the question before theihouse.A>[iiA>ZItA>Ws how big will a brook trout grow--in a brook?A>[iiA>ZI donA>Wt know.A>[iiA>ZBut you must have some idea,A>[ Tom urged. A>ZWhatA>Ws the biggest you everisaw?A>[iiA>ZIt was so big IA>Wd hate to say jest how big it was.A>[iiA>ZI donA>Wt understand.A>[iiLon deliberated a moment, while the boys, getting hint of a story, drewicloser.iiA>ZWell, I say I saw the big fellow, but thatA>Ws sort oA>W misleadinA>W. IididnA>Wt see well enough to go to measurinA>W or estimatinA>W in feet andiinches, or in pounds, for that matter. But I did see Old Man FreemanA>WsiWilliam Trout, and he was a buster, I tell ye!A>[iiA>ZFreemanA>Ws William Trout?A>[ Sam repeated. A>ZWhatA>Ws that? A species?A>[iiA>ZNope--straight brook trout. Leastwise, Old Man Freeman said so.A>[iiA>ZSeems to me IA>Wve heard of Freeman,A>[ Poke put in. A>ZGuess my father knewiabout him.A>[iiA>ZLikelier your grandfather. A>WTwas a good ways back when he flourished.iI was a little shaver fust off in our acquaintance.A>[iiA>ZLetA>Ws have the story!A>[ cried Step.iiA>ZYes--the story!A>[ echoed Poke.iiA>ZWell, I ainA>Wt got my notes with me, but IA>Wll do my best to entertainithe company,A>[ said Lon. A>ZWay of it was this: When I was the age ofiyou chaps--no; I guess A>Wtwas when I was a size smaller--there wasnA>Wtianything IA>Wd rather do than get out on a good brook A>Wlong in theispring. And there waA>WnA>Wt many brooks in my part oA>W the country that IididnA>Wt try to see if they was good or not. So that was how, workinA>Wialong a stream way back in the hills one day, I stumbled on Old ManiFreemanA>Ws place.iiA>ZIt was a new brook to me, and there was a lot of woods, so I was doinA>Wia heap oA>W wadinA>W, the brook beinA>W the nearest thing to a path thereiwas. I wasnA>Wt payinA>W much attention to the scenery, and I guess I plumbiforgot it when I come to jest about the most promisinA>W lookinA>W pool youiever sot eyes on. But I hadnA>Wt moreA>Wn dropped in my hook when thereiwas a roar like a bullA>Ws, and a wild old codger was rushinA>W at me.iHe grabbed me by the collar, and yanked me up the bank, and began toishake my back teeth loose. Course, I wriggled and fit like a cat, butiA>WtwaA>WnA>Wt no use. Mebbe that was so plain it kinder reminded him whatia little fellow I was, for, after a while, he quit treatinA>W me like aibottle oA>W medicine before takinA>W, and stopped to have a good look atime. Then he asked me, mighty sharp, what in tarnation I meant by tryinA>Wito catch his pet trout Bill, and why I didnA>Wt stay home and tend to myiown business, or couldnA>Wt my folks find nothinA>W for me to do.iiA>ZWell, I got back breath enough to say that I didnA>Wt mean no harm, andiIA>Wd never heard tell oA>W his Bill, and if he didnA>Wt leggo oA>W me heA>Wd beisorry--you know the kind oA>W oratory a youngster puts up in a case likeithat. I guess it didnA>Wt skeer him none; but it gave him a chance toilook me over some more. All of a sudden he says, A>VBoy, you watch sharp,iand you wonA>Wt have to have nobody tell you about Old Man FreemanA>WsiBill. Now look!A>WiiA>ZThen he lets go my collar, and steps forward, and bends over theiwater, and pats it two-three times with his cupped hand. And thereA>Ws aiswish and a swirl, and something comes shootinA>W across the pool. Andithe somethingA>Ws the biggest trout IA>Wd ever see or ever dreamed of.iNot that I made him out like print, as you might say--I couldnA>Wt tellijest where he began or where he ended, but in between them pA>Wints wasia mighty lot oA>W concentrated trout. He whirled around the old manA>Wsihand--playinA>W tag with him, by jingo!--and then he shot back across theipool like a streak oA>W fish lightninA>W.iiA>ZI guess I gave a gasp like a fish out oA>W water. A>VMy eye, Mister,A>W saysiI, A>Vbut heA>Ws biggerA>Wn I be!A>WiiA>ZNow, a jokeA>Ws like the measles; you never can tell how good itA>Ws goinA>Wito take hold; sometimes itA>Ws jest a flat failure like a case oA>W mockimeasles. Then again itA>Ws the real thing. That was the way with Old ManiFreeman. Somehow IA>Wd hit his funny bone, and hit it hard. He looked atime for a minute, his face creasinA>W crosswise till I thought the skinA>Wdicrack. And then he hawhawed. Boys, I tell you, I never heard such ailaugh before! It fair creaked, his laughinA>W machinery was so rusty fromilack oA>W use! And he shook till I thought his old clothesA>Wd drop offihim. But that laugh did a lot. It made me and Old Man Freeman friendsifor life.A>[iiA>ZBut didnA>Wt he tell you how much his trout weighed?A>[ Poke demanded.iiLon shook his head. A>ZHe didnA>Wt; for he didnA>Wt know. He didnA>Wt have noimore scales than a hornpout.A>[iiA>ZYou mean the big trout didnA>Wt?A>[iiA>ZI mean Old Man Freeman. He didnA>Wt have many oA>W what youA>Wd calliluxuries. Fact is, he lived like a hermit in a cabin beside the brook.iHe trapped some, and raised a few vegetables, and got along somehow.iHeA>Wd no kith or kin, so farA>Ws I ever heard of. And about his onlyiinterest in life was his Bill Trout. HeA>Wd sit beside the pool, anditalk to that fish sameA>Ws if he was a human. And he fed him--oh, yes;iBill didnA>Wt go hungry if Old Man Freeman did. Later on I found thatiif I wanted to be real popular, the way to do it was to bring along aicouple oA>W pound oA>W liver for Bill Trout. And Bill seemed to understandia heap--for a fish. HeA>Wd let the old man pet him; and he got so heididnA>Wt mind havinA>W me around, though we never got what youA>Wd call realifamiliar.A>[iiA>ZBut youA>Wre not giving us much light on how much a trout can weigh,A>[iSam objected, as Lon paused.iiA>ZWell, for one thing, I ainA>Wt quite through with the story. Happenedithere was a long spell when I couldnA>Wt go to see Old Man Freeman. I wasidown country, workinA>W. Must A>WaA>W been all of five-six years before Iigot out to the cabin. The old man didnA>Wt know me fust off, IA>Wd growediso. Fact is, he come at me mighty hostile with a shotgun; but when IA>Wdipersuaded him I was jest a small boy shot up a foot or two, he allowediI didnA>Wt need no more shootinA>W, and was real glad to see me.iiA>ZA>VAnd whatA>Ws become oA>W Bill?A>W says I. A>VHanginA>W round the place yet, isihe?A>WiiA>ZA>VWilliam Trout is very well, thanky; if itA>Ws him youA>Wre alludinA>W to,A>Wisays the old codger, mighty solemn.iiA>ZA>VWilliam Trout?A>W says I, kinder questioning.iiA>ZA>VYes, William,A>W says he, wagginA>W his head like a good fellow. A>VItiainA>Wt fittinA>W and proper to be puttinA>W no nicknames on a fish oA>W hisiheft and traininA>W. But come along and take a look at William.A>WiiA>ZWell, we went down to the pool, and Old Man Freeman cupped his handiand slapped the water. There was a sunbeam pourinA>W down through aibreak in the leaves overhead, and hittinA>W the water so that right inithe middle was a space all bright and shininA>W, and around it a band ofistill and shadowy surface. The big trout must A>WaA>W been feelinA>W hisioats that day, for as he shot out of the shadow and into the brightnessihe gave a leap. Jerusalem! Talk about prisms and rainbows! There heiwas for jest a second, archinA>W like the bow and blazinA>W like a sunset,iwith the gleaminA>W drops fallinA>W from him in a shower of jewels. Then,isplash! He was under again, and the water near the old manA>Ws hand wasia boilinA>W swirl. This time I didnA>Wt even gasp. I hadnA>Wt breath enoughileft. I jest stood there, shakinA>W.A>[iiA>ZBut how big was he?A>[ persisted Poke.iiLon hesitated an instant. A>ZI--well, I ainA>Wt sayinA>W what my guess wouldibe--and itA>Wd have to be a guess. If I told the whole truth--or what IibelieveA>Ws the truth--none oA>W youA>Wd believe me. I dunnoA>Ws Ananias everiwent fishinA>W, but thereA>Ws them asA>Wd figger heA>Wd A>WaA>W had a special giftithat way. And I never sot out to qualify in the Ananias class.A>[iiA>ZBut you must have some notion?A>[iiA>ZYes; I have a notion,A>[ Lon said slowly. A>ZItA>Ws a notion that IA>Wve seeniA>VlakersA>W paraded as big fish that werenA>Wt as husky chaps as Old ManiFreemanA>Ws square-tail William Trout. But thatA>Ws as fur as IA>Wll go.A>[iiThere was a momentA>Ws silence in the group about the fire. Sam ended it.iiA>ZIA>Wve heard my father say size was pretty much a matter of conditions.iSo, with the right conditions, I suppose a brook trout could do prettyiwell.A>[iiLon nodded. A>ZThatA>Ws about it, Sam. And William Trout was a regA>Wlariparlor boarder. He lived in a natA>Wral trout brook, which means a brookithat yields trout food; then Old Man Freeman kept fattinA>W up hisirations. So he had nothinA>W to do but keep on growinA>W and growinA>W.A>[iiA>ZBut I should think somebodyA>Wd have caught him,A>[ Step put in.iiA>ZThe old man stood guard. HeA>Wd posted his land with A>VNo fishinA>WA>W signs,iand he was runninA>W a shotgun quarantine to boot. Fact is, he peppereditwo-three trespassers with birdshot, and after that got to be known heiwasnA>Wt bothered much.A>[iiA>ZBut why did the fish stay in the pool? Why didnA>Wt he run down streamior up?A>[iiLon chuckled. A>ZThat was where Old Man Freeman figgered again. He likedito let on that William Trout lingered from pure affection for him, butiI noticed that what with rocks and wire there was a fairly effectiveifish-screen below the pool. It didnA>Wt show much, but it was there. Andithere was another a lot like it higher up. No; the big trout was cagediall right. And that, I reckon, was why Old Man Freeman come to be deadiwhere they found him.A>[iiA>ZGo on! Tell us!A>[ cried two or three together.iiA>ZWell, that summer I was out to see the old man half a dozen times. Heiwas growinA>W mighty stiff and feeble, and more obstinate and notionaliabout William Trout. HeA>Wd sit on the bank for hours, mumblinA>W toihimself and talkinA>W to that fish. And William--he was livelierA>Wn aicricket, but, somehow, I never seemed to get a chance to look himiover, cool and calculatinA>W. The old man let on he was worryinA>W aboutiwhatA>Wd happen to William, if he should be took sick, allowinA>W that theicritterA>Wd die of a broken heart or some such foolishness. I tried toicheer him up, but it didnA>Wt do no good. WilliamA>Wd pine and waste away,iand that was all there was to it. But one day, when I heard that OldiMan Freeman was dead, and that somebodyA>Wd found him lyinA>W between theibrook and his cabin, and when I went out to the place--well, IA>Wll owniup I took a look for William Trout. I couldnA>Wt spy him nowhere in theipool. I cupped the water, but he didnA>Wt come. Then I prodded aroundiwith a pole, and still no William! That sot me thinkinA>W. I moseyedidown to the screen below the pool, and sure enough, the wires was cut.iI reckoned I knew what had happened. The old man must A>WaA>W felt theilast attack cominA>W on, and used up what strength he had gettinA>W to theiwire and clearinA>W a way for William to scoot--he didnA>Wt mean to haveino fellow with a net scoopinA>W up the big fish and never givinA>W him aichance. And William, he found the gap, and vamoosed; and the old man,ihe tried to get back to the cabin, and dropped half-way. So that wasithe end of the story for both of them, so far as I ever heard tell.A>[iiA>ZBut didnA>Wt anybody ever catch the big trout?A>[ queried Step.iiA>ZEnough tried--they fair wore a path along the bank below the pool;ibut nobody landed William. There were a couple oA>W ponds the brook runithrough, and he might A>WaA>W stayed in one of A>Wem, or then again he mightiA>WaA>W navigated right through to the big river. Anyhow, he dropped out oA>Wisight, and stayed out. And thatA>Ws the end of the story. And the moraliof it? Well, I dunnoA>Ws thereA>Ws any moral, exactly, except that youicanA>Wt get me to say how big a brook trout can grow.A>[iiA>ZWhereA>Ws the brook he lived in?A>[ asked Poke.iiA>ZOh, over there!A>[ Lon said, and jerked a thumb over his shoulder. A>ZSomeiways off. And A>WtwouldnA>Wt interest you boys now--there ainA>Wt no moreiWilliam Trouts in it.A>[ Then he rose to his feet, and his tone changed.iA>ZLook here, youngsters! Time we was movinA>W along, if you donA>Wt expectito put up here over night. You get me yarninA>W about my misspent youth,iand I donA>Wt notice how late itA>Ws gettinA>W to be.A>[iiThe club followed his example, and rose, not too willingly. The duskihad deepened, but it was still very pleasant to lounge about the dyingifire.iiA>ZWell, I suppose weA>Wll have to go back to town,A>[ Sam said reluctantly.iA>ZThereA>Ws school in the morning, as usual.A>[iiA>ZThatA>Ws so--worse luck!A>[ growled Step.iiLon began to kick dirt upon the embers.iiA>ZNo use takinA>W unnecessary chances,A>[ he remarked. A>ZItA>Ws powerful dry inithe woods just now, and you never can tell whatA>Wd happen if a breezeishould spring up and find a spark to carry. And this ainA>Wt a goodicountry to fight a healthy forest fire in. Too much truck jest waitinA>Wito burn, I tell you!A>[iiA>ZHuh! IA>Wd like to see a good, ripping old fire once,A>[ said Step. A>ZIA>Wveinever had the luck to be close to one.A>[iiA>ZThen youA>Wve been luckier than you know,A>[ said Lon drily, and sent aishower of dust upon the coals.iiiiiCHAPTER XIII PLAYING THE GAMEiiiThe camp at the lake very quickly proved its value to Sam and hisifriends. It gave them a place of resort, an occupation. Poke and Stepicontinued to be absorbed in the construction of their aeroplane, butithe others were glad to have an excuse for a hike, or an overnight stayiunder canvas, or a week-end outing. Gradually they were adding to theiequipment; and were making a comfortable nest in the woods. Possiblyitheir zeal was increased by the fact that their relations with the restiof the class showed no improvement.iiPrivately, Sam speculated a good deal about this. In his experienceischool disputes had a way of wearing themselves out, so to speak. Itiwas quite true that the Safety First Club was not making overtures toithe others; but ordinarily in the boy-world, as he knew it, somethingiwould happen to make everybody forget temporarily causes of offense andileave feuds a little dulled. In this instance, though, there were noiamicable interludes. What might be called a state of armed neutralityicontinued. Sam, meditating, reached the conclusion that Zorn was stillitaking the trouble to circulate his stories to the discredit of theiclub.iiIn one way or another, Sam chanced to see little of Zorn for a week oritwo after their roadside interview. He was still urging his chums toikeep a close watch upon the doings of the enemy, but none of them madeidiscoveries throwing light upon the problem Zorn offered.iiThe Trojan continued to demand SamA>Ws vigilance. He had reached a sortiof acceptance of the situation, and with the coaching of his friendsiin Latin was keeping up his classwork, after a fashion; but there wasino heart in his performance. The sense of suffering from injusticeirankled, and whatever he did was because of his promise to Sam ratherithan because of desire to hold his place in the school.iiLon, in these days, was a tower of strength to Sam. He was shrewd andiobservant, and really understood the position of the club and itsidifficulties.iiA>ZKeep at it; play the game!A>[ was his advice. A>ZI donA>Wt go to say itA>Wsithe best game you could have picked out; but then, again, I ainA>WtisayinA>W itA>Ws the wust. And with any game I ever see or heard tell on,ithe only thing to do was to play it honest and play it through, andikeep your eyes open and learn what the gameA>Wll teach you. The one thingithat sure ainA>Wt got no use or profit in it is wobblinA>W, and shiftinA>W,iand changinA>W your mind back and forth like a feller experimentinA>W withihis fust pair oA>W shoes thatA>Ws rights and lefts. ThatA>Ws what I saysito Poke the other day, when he had me over to take a squint at thatiblessed Scary Hen oA>W his.A>[iiA>ZA>VScary Hen?A>WA>[ Sam repeated dubiously.iiA>ZYep! That bird contrivance heA>Ws putting together.A>[iiA>ZOh, you mean his Saracen,A>[ said Sam, enlightened.iiLon nodded. A>ZIA>Wm callinA>W it the Scary Hen--I do love a name that fits!iYou see, he had me in, sort oA>W consultinA>W engineer-like, to paw overithat old motor he acquired from Philanthropist Haskins. ItA>Ws sure someiengine!A>[iiA>ZBut it never will work, will it--for PokeA>Ws purposes, I mean?A>[iiLon rubbed his chin. A>ZWell, I dunno. Somehow, way IA>Wm built in mindiand body, I kinder fancy having a foot or a wheel touchinA>W ground. Iinever was intended to scoot round, bumpinA>W the birds. So mebbe IA>Wmiprejudiced, when it comes to flyinA>W machines. But that old motor--well,iitA>Ws an antique, all right, and itA>Ws got trimminA>Ws I hainA>Wt seen iniyears, and I reckon itA>Ws a gasoline hog for keeps, but A>Wtis high speed,isure enough. LikelyA>Ws not A>Wtwas made for some old-time racinA>W car. AndiI will say Poke or Step, one of A>Wem, has got a knack with machinery;ifor theyA>Wve got Methusaleh to workinA>W so well that I wouldnA>Wt trustimyself behind him, if he was rigged in a road roller. But as for whatithey will do with the power theyA>Wre generatinA>W, and the schemes theyA>Wveifiggered out to twirl the propeller--say, that sort oA>W stuff is allioff my beat. I did give A>Wem a hint or two about changinA>W wirinA>W, butithere I stopped. And as for the name of the contraption--say, now, Sam!iif those boys donA>Wt scare the feathers off every hen in ten mile, IA>WmimissinA>W my guess. That motorA>Wll work fast enough, but it coughs like aimillion chokinA>W dogs, and the way it misses fire now and then--whew!ibut itA>Ws enough to make a man or a rooster jump out of his skin! ButiPoke says mufflers are barred on flyinA>W machines, and so there youiare! YouA>Wve got to be in the fashion if you bust all the neighborsA>Wiear-drums.A>[iiSam, who had no confidence in PokeA>Ws great experiment, next consultedithe Shark, whom he found to be pessimistic, but guarded in statement.iiA>ZI havenA>Wt got it worked out yet for Poke,A>[ he said, A>Zand until Iifinish the calculation, IA>Wm not going to open my head, except to remarkithat I guess most flyers have to make a lot of tests and take someitumbles before they soar. Just now, though, IA>Wm trying to find out justiwhat will happen when a given propeller turns a given number of timesiin a second and thereA>Ws a given area of plane. I donA>Wt know yet, butiIA>Wm going to know.A>[iiWell as he knew the Shark and highly as he respected his mathematicalitalents, Sam was impressed.iiA>ZGeeminy! But thatA>Ws a stunt youA>Wve set yourself!A>[iiA>ZCertainly it is,A>[ said the Shark calmly. A>ZIf it wasnA>Wt one, I wouldnA>Wtibother with it. IA>Wd never dabbled in aeronautics, you know, and itA>Wsimore or less of a job to look up the formul"d. No; if it wasnA>Wt for theisport of calculating----A>[iiA>ZSport!A>[ Sam interrupted, incredulously.iiA>ZBest ever!A>[iiA>ZWell, itA>Ws all in the way you look at it. And--er--er--one manA>Ws meatiis another manA>Ws poison.A>[iiA>ZCourse!A>[ the Shark shrugged. A>ZAnd if I didnA>Wt find the game worth theicandle, you donA>Wt think, do you, that IA>Wd be fussing with this schemeiof PokeA>Ws? ThereA>Wd be a deal easier way to answer the question whetherior not his machine would fly--the empirical way.A>[iiA>ZEh? WhatA>Ws that?A>[iiA>ZLet him try to fly and see what happens.A>[iiA>ZBut he might break his neck.A>[iiA>ZWell, heA>Wd have the answer then, wouldnA>Wt he?A>[iiA>ZMaybe--but it wouldnA>Wt do him much good.A>[iiA>ZTrue--but the question would be answered,A>[ observed the Shark,iunemotionally. A>ZThatA>Ws the main point of interest.A>[iiSam did not think it worth while to dispute the assertion. Instead, heileft the Shark to his calculations, and hied him to PokeA>Ws barn.iiThere a glance revealed much apparent progress. Motor and plane hadibeen brought together--assembled, as Poke hastened to explain.iiA>ZIf this were a boat, weA>Wd be ready for dock trials,A>[ said he. A>ZThatA>Wllishow you how far weA>Wve got along.A>[iiA>ZWhy donA>Wt you make it one of the boat kind--hydro-aeroplanes, arenA>Wtithey?A>[ Sam asked. A>ZThen, if you fell into the water----A>[iiA>ZShucks! I donA>Wt intend to fall,A>[ Poke put in hastily. A>ZAnd thereA>Wdibe no use in pontoon attachments. IA>Wm going to do my flying at fairsimostly, where there wouldnA>Wt be any ponds handy; for fairs are whereithe money will be, and IA>Wm out for the cash.A>[iiA>ZOh! I remember,A>[ said Sam, and drew closer to inspect the machine.iiThe contrivance was supported on bicycle wheels. The use of these andiof the planes--Poke appeared to have decided on a biplane model--Samiunderstood in a general way, but he was all at sea about the functionsiof various levers and cords grouped about the operatorA>Ws seat, aibicycle saddle fitted with a back and perched not too securely, by hisinotion, on the framework. It occurred to the visitor that the spread ofiwing was not so great as he had supposed it would have to be; and heiventured a remark to this effect.iiPoke waved a careless hand. A>ZOh, thatA>Ws all right--increased speed ofimotor has A>Wtended to that difficulty. DonA>Wt you worry, Sam!A>[iiSam said nothing, but moved slowly around the machine, eyeing iticlosely.iiA>ZIA>Wd give you a demonstration--kind of a drill, that is,A>[ said Poke,iA>Zif all the rigging were complete. But it isnA>Wt, quite. Step, you see,iis working out the details--heA>Ws a crackerjack of a mechanic--regularigenius. Just now some of his ideas are sort of--well, sort of iniembryo--and things arenA>Wt fixed just the way theyA>Wll be when weA>Wreiready to give an exhibition. ThatA>Wll be before very long, though.A>[iiA>ZSo?A>[iiA>ZYes; Step and I have figured out just what to do. When weA>Wre ready foripractice flights, weA>Wll take the Saracen out to the lake, where thereA>Wsielbow-room in the big field, and where we wonA>Wt be bothered by crowds.iThereA>Ws an old shed in which we can keep the machine at night, andiweA>Wll take care to lug it out to the lake without attracting attention.iThis is a private affair till we get ready for public exhibitions, youiknow.A>[iiA>ZBut lots of people must have been getting some sort of an idea aboutiit--an idea, anyway, that youA>Wre up to something.A>[iiA>ZWell, the motor does make a racket when we give it a test whirl. Thenisome fellows have come rubbering around--thatA>Ws true. But Step and IihavenA>Wt peeped. Why, the other day, Jack Hagle----A>[ There Poke paused,ia line of perplexity showing, of a sudden, in his forehead. A>ZI say,iSam! there was something funny about HagleA>Ws actions. You know what aiqueer way he has sometimes--almost hang-dog, itA>Ws so cringing? Well, heiwas fair ready to fawn all over us, but the funny part was, he wantedito talk about the Trojan. It was as if he made our scheme an excuse foriasking about our gang, first in general and then in particular aboutithe Trojan. And he said he was sorry for him--he said it twice. HeididnA>Wt explain, though.A>[iiA>ZDid you ask him to?A>[iiA>ZN-no. You see, we wanted to get rid of him, so we didnA>Wt make any moreitalk than we had to. After heA>Wd gone we happened to think of the queeriside of his performance.A>[iiA>ZUmph!A>[ said Sam, non-committally. He regretted that Poke had notiencouraged Hagle to talk, but understood that at present the Saracenirepresented almost everything the builder deemed worth a thought. JackiHagle, shuffling, vacillating, a weakling, counted for little in theiopinion of the boys of the town; it was not cause for wonder that Pokeihad been glad to be rid of him. But Sam was beginning to suspect thatiin some way or other, at present beyond his knowledge, Hagle mightibe able to throw light on the mystery which lay at the bottom of theitroubles of the club.iiAbout this time, too, Herman Boyd made a discovery, which causediSam some uneasiness. There had been a sale of land near the lake,ithe purchase being made by a syndicate in which ZornA>Ws father wasiinterested.iiA>ZI couldnA>Wt find out just the boundaries,A>[ Herman reported, A>Zbut I wasitold that the tract is across the lake from the pavilion. ThatA>Wd put itisomewhere in our district.A>[iiSam nodded. A>ZIt might, certainly.... If it does, I reckon we may haveito move--if Ed Zorn can stir up his father to evict us.A>[iiA>ZWell, the Zorns have taken one of the new cottages. I hear quite ainumber of families are going to be in the lake colony this summer.A>[iiA>ZUmph! If they donA>Wt bother us, weA>Wll agree not to bother them,A>[ Samiremarked. A>ZWe are managing to flock by ourselves pretty successfully.A>[iiA>ZOh, thatA>Ws our game, all right,A>[ declared Herman.iiA>ZAnd weA>Wll play it through,A>[ Sam insisted.iiA>ZSure! Only--only,A>[--Herman hesitated--A>Zonly itA>Ws curious, Sam, howilong this row with the rest of the class keeps up.A>[iiA>ZWell, we didnA>Wt start it, but we can stand it as long as the otherifellows can. They can let us alone, and we can let them alone--andithatA>Ws all there is to it.A>[iiBut A>Zletting aloneA>[ is not always an easy course, in affairs eitherigreat or small. So Sam was convinced when he heard of the battleibetween Tom Orkney and Scrub Payne, who, it will be recalled, hadiblacked PokeA>Ws eye in the early stages of the feud. Orkney had vowedito avenge his friend, and had not forgotten his pledge. Accordingly,iwhen he came upon Poke and Payne in the middle of an excited group, andiheard loud sounds of dispute, he shouldered a way through the press andiwas just in time to see Scrub cuff the smaller boy.iiOrkney caught ScrubA>Ws arm and half turned him in his tracks.iiA>ZTake somebody of your size!A>[ he challenged. A>ZCut out this hazing theikids!A>[iiAt that Poke flamed in wrath against his ally. A>ZKid yourself, Orkney!A>[ihe roared. A>ZSay, you keep out of this! I can do my own fighting.A>[iiA>ZAll right, fight me--afterward,A>[ said Orkney coolly. A>ZDonA>Wt bother meinow, though. IA>Wve had a date with this fellow for a good while, and IA>Wmigoing to keep it.A>[iiPayne did not shun combat. Indeed, he hastened it; for he struck Orkneyisharply in the chest. Tom, who had been vigilantly watching for justisuch an overture, countered heavily on ScrubA>Ws forehead. The crowd felliback at once, leaving space for the opponents; and in another instantithe fight was in full progress.iiIn weight there was little advantage on either side, though Payne hadigreater height and longer reach. Neither was a highly skilled boxer.iThe one great point in OrkneyA>Ws favor was a certain grim determinationiwhich counted amazingly in helping him endure punishment, of which, itimust be confessed, he took a deal, largely because he was so bent oniinflicting it. It was, in short, a A>Zhammer and tongsA>[ affair, as Pokeisubsequently described it to Sam, with Orkney playing for the otherA>Wsihead and bent on repaying PokeA>Ws blackened eye in kind; with no rounds,iwith scant thought of the rules. Long the issue hung in the balance. Soiwell matched were the two, in fact, that many of the onlookers supposediPayne was at least holding his own, when, suddenly, he threw an armiover his sorely battered face, whipped about, and took to his heels,ileaving Tom an undisputed victor, but one who manifestly had had to payifor his victory.iiPoke escorted Orkney home; then hastened to Sam, to whom he told hisitale of battle.iiA>ZSay, but it was a ripping old fight!A>[ was his conclusion. A>ZAnd weiwere on top! Sam, itA>Ws the turn in the luck for the Safety First Club!A>[iiA>ZI hope it is,A>[ Sam answered gravely. At the moment he was sharplyireminded by OrkneyA>Ws achievement of his own yet to be settled accountiwith Zorn.iiiiiCHAPTER XIV AGAIN AT THE COUNCIL ROCKiiiOrkneyA>Ws battle with Scrub Payne made a great stir in the school. Thereiwere some evidences of a change in the popular temper, which might beitaken to bear out PokeA>Ws view that the luck had turned. Sam and hisichums noted more signs of good will; they had reason to believe thatisome of the boys who had voted with them at the election of a classisecretary were now ready to ally themselves openly with the club. Onithe other hand, though, there was nothing to indicate that Zorn wasilosing his hold upon the majority of the class, between whom and theiclub the line continued to be sharply drawn.iiThe club still flocked by itself. No outsider had been invited to visitithe camp on the lake shore, and no visitor appeared there. On the otheriside of the sheet of water activities were increasing. Although theibuildings had not been completed, the big pavilion was in conditionifor use, and a band played there Saturday afternoons and evenings. Someiof the cottages were occupied, and there was much travel on the roadileading from town to the new resort. On several occasions Sam saw Zornispeeding along on his motorcycle, going at a great pace and raising aithick cloud of dust; and he had glimpses, too, of Jack Hagle driving byiin a light wagon. But they were only glimpses. The fine, dry weatheriheld, and the dust was so deep along the highway that the boys, whenithey hiked back and forth, often preferred to take to the fields,iavoiding the smother of the dust clouds.iiBy night, and with all precautions for secrecy, Poke and Stepitransferred the dismantled Saracen to the shed by the big field,iand then set themselves to reassembling the monster, helped on by aiholiday. They declined assistance from their chums.iiA>ZYou chaps mean well,A>[ Poke told them, A>Zbut the machine has a lot ofidelicate adjustments, and--well, I donA>Wt want to hurt your feelings,ibut your fingers would be all thumbs. So you just leave things to Stepiand me, and weA>Wll show you.A>[iiA>ZWhen?A>[ somebody asked pointedly.iiA>ZPretty quick,A>[ Poke replied. A>ZOf course, all the--er--er--all theirigging wonA>Wt be in place, but in a jiffy weA>Wll have things so farialong that we can give you a pretty good demonstration.A>[iiSam was moved to urge caution. A>ZDonA>Wt be in too much of a hurry. We caniwait.A>[iiA>ZDonA>Wt you worry!A>[ Poke retorted with a touch of dignity. A>ZWeA>Wre goingiabout this whole thing right. WeA>Wre going to look mathematically beforeiwe leap--understand?A>[iiSam interpreted this as meaning that the Shark had not yet completedihis computations; and the Shark, on inquiry, admitted that this was theicase.iiA>ZIA>Wm not going to make any mistakes, if I can help it,A>[ he declared.iA>ZToo serious business.A>[iiA>ZIt surely is,A>[ Sam agreed. A>ZBroken bones are no joke.A>[iiA>ZHuh! ItA>Ws worse to find youA>Wre wrong in your calculations!A>[iiSam surveyed the mathematician sternly. A>ZConfound it, Shark! CanA>Wt youibe human?A>[iiA>ZIA>Wm mighty human,A>[ vowed the other. A>ZI hate to have to confess IA>Wveiblundered.A>[iiA>ZBut everybody blunders sometimes.A>[iiA>ZOught not to--not when itA>Ws a case of mathematics.A>[iiSam thought this over. A>ZWell, I hope thereA>Wll be no slip in yourifigures this time,A>[ he said soberly.iiA>ZHuh! There wonA>Wt be,A>[ quoth the Shark calmly. A>ZIA>Wll know just whereiIA>Wm at before I say a word.A>[ And with that he resumed his attentionito the sheets of mysterious diagrams and computations, which he hadibrought with him to the camp.iiIt was a week-end stay the club was making at the lake. All the membersiwere there, but when the Shark returned to his labors in the tent,iSam for the moment found himself alone. Herman was fishing somewhereialong the shore, Poke and Step were fully occupied with the flyingimachine, Tom Orkney had led the somewhat reluctant Trojan aside, andiwas coaching him on a Latin lesson. Sam strolled over to the bigiCouncil Rock and perched himself on one of its ledges. There he wasihalf-meditating, half-dozing, when Herman came into sight, hurryingialong at a great pace. Instantly he hailed Sam:iiA>ZSay, IA>Wve found something--got a tip of trouble! Call the crowditogether, and IA>Wll tell you.A>[iiSam shouted lustily. Step and Poke were out of hearing, and the Sharkikept at his task, but Orkney and the Trojan came readily enough. Theyiranged themselves beside Sam, and awaited HermanA>Ws tidings.iiA>ZWell, it was this way,A>[ he explained. A>ZI was fooling along, noticatching anything and not caring much whether I got a nibble or not.iAnd, all of a sudden, that young Hagle came out of the bushes, anditiptoed up, as if he were afraid of his life. I donA>Wt like him. So Iiwas pulling in my line and getting ready to quit, when he began toistammer out something about my waiting to hear some important news.iI asked him what it was, and he stammered worse than ever, and keptiturning and peering around, as if he thought a bear was about to jumpiout at us. It wasnA>Wt easy to make head or tail of what he said; butifinally I caught his drift. It was about the ownership of the landiweA>Wre on. Well, it seems itA>Ws part of the tract ZornA>Ws father bought,iand EdA>Ws stirring up his father to have us fired as trespassers.A>[iiTom Orkney whistled; SamA>Ws expression grew anxious.iiA>ZI wonder if his father will do it,A>[ said the Trojan.iiA>ZI asked about that,A>[ Herman went on. A>ZHagle thought he might put usioff. It wouldnA>Wt be so much because we were we--because it was ouricrowd, you know--as because the syndicate wouldnA>Wt want to have anybodyion the land. And thereA>Ws always the chance of campers starting a fire,iespecially when things are as dry as they are now.A>[iiThe boys nodded agreement. A>ZFire surely would run through the brushilike a racer,A>[ quoth Orkney.iiA>ZWell,A>[ said Herman, A>Zit was kind of surprising to have Hagle trying toido us a good turn. I guess I blurted out something of the sort. Anyway,iJack got more flustered than ever and more nervous, and between theiway he mumbled and his wriggles when he turned to see if anybody wasispying on us I didnA>Wt catch half he said. But what I did catch seemedito be about being sorry for something or somebody. And then he brokeioff short, and beat it. Say! he slipped away like a snake almost! Funnyichap, that Hagle, I tell you!A>[iiA>ZSeems to mean well, though,A>[ Orkney observed.iiHerman was glancing at Sam as leader of the clan. A>ZWhatA>Ws your notioniabout the business?A>[ he asked.iiA>ZThat for some reason or other Hagle is trying to do us a favor. IidonA>Wt know why--I donA>Wt see how we can discover the reason. But weA>Wdibetter take advantage of his tip.A>[iiA>ZHow?A>[ Orkney inquired.iiA>ZBy going straight to Mr. Zorn and asking permission to stay where weiare.A>[iiA>ZThatA>Wd be taking the bull by the horns.A>[iiA>ZItA>Ws the best way. If weA>Wve got to leave, letA>Ws go gracefully and notibe kicked out.A>[iiA>ZThatA>Ws sense!A>[ the Trojan declared.iiA>ZRight!A>[ said Orkney. A>ZBut when will you look Mr. Zorn up?A>[iiA>ZNow--right away,A>[ Sam answered. A>ZVery likely heA>Ws at his cottage thisiafternoon.A>[iiA>ZWant any company?A>[iiSam deliberated a moment. A>ZYes. Maybe it would be a good scheme toihave the crowd along, so he could look us over and see that weA>Wre notidangerous.A>[iiA>ZThen youA>Wll take Poke and Step and the Shark?A>[iiA>ZWeA>Wll give them a chance to go, anyway.A>[iiBut the Shark, as it proved, preferred to remain in the camp. Heigrowled savagely when Sam looked into the tent.iiA>ZHang it all, donA>Wt interrupt me! Keep away, canA>Wt you? IA>Wm justigetting where IA>Wve tried to arrive for a week. IA>Wll be there in fiveiminutes more, if only youA>Wll let me alone.A>[iiA>ZAll right; suit yourself,A>[ said Sam, and stepped back. He beckoned toiOrkney, the Trojan and Herman, and led the way through the woods to theished in the big field.iiThere, evidently, something was doing. The Saracen was standing iniplain sight before the shed, poised trimly on the bicycle wheels andiwith wings symmetrically out-spread. Step was pottering about theimotor, while Poke, hands on hips, was surveying the machine withiimmense satisfaction.iiA>ZHulloo! What! Finished, is it?A>[ Sam inquired with interest.iiA>ZOh, practically,A>[ replied Poke loftily. A>ZFew odds and ends to beiadjusted, maybe--thatA>Ws all.A>[iiA>ZDo you mean youA>Wre ready to fly?A>[iiA>ZWhy not?A>[iiSam coughed dubiously.iiStep, finishing his work on the motor, joined the others. A>ZSome bird ofia job there, eh?A>[ he remarked complacently.iiA>ZUmph! Proof of the bird is the flying,A>[ said Orkney drily.iiPoke and Step exchanged glances. A>ZOh, sheA>Wll fly fast enough,A>[ theiformer declared. A>ZStart the motor, then get her to moving, then shiftithe planes, and--whisk, there you are!A>[iiA>ZWhere are you?A>[iiA>ZUp over head, and going like sixty!A>[iiA>ZShucks! I donA>Wt believe it.A>[iiAgain the builders glanced at each other. A>ZMight start her up, and letiA>Wem see how she pulls,A>[ Step suggested.iiSam now noticed that a rope ran from the rear of the machine to aistump, to which it was made fast.iiA>ZOh, youA>Wre anchored, are you?A>[ said he.iiA>ZThatA>Ws so we can make a test, and judge the power weA>Wre getting fromithe propeller.A>[iiA>ZHurrah! LetA>Ws see the wheels go round,A>[ cried Herman.iiA>ZWhy--why, I guess we can show you,A>[ said Poke.iiA>ZSure we can!A>[ declared Step enthusiastically; and, marching backito the machine, cranked the motor. There was a tremendous sputter,ifollowed by a deafening barking. Step stretched his long arms anditugged at a lever, whereat the propeller began to revolve smoothly andiswiftly.iiStep shut off the power, and as the noise of the motor ceased peered atihis friends. One or two had their hands at their ears, but all appearedito be impressed by the performance.iiA>ZWell, what are you going to say now?A>[ he demanded.iiA>ZSo far, so good,A>[ said Sam. A>ZOnly----A>[iiA>ZWhatA>Ws the use of A>VonlyA>W and A>VifA>W and A>VbutA>W and all such discouragingitalk? YouA>Wll never get anywhere by it.A>[iiA>ZThe SaracenA>Ws in grand voice--IA>Wll say so much for him,A>[ Hermanivolunteered.iiA>ZHo, ho! That isnA>Wt a marker to his performance when he really getsigoing and warms up.A>[iiTom Orkney had been regarding the machine intently. A>ZLook here, Step!A>[ihe said. A>ZYouA>Wve no self-starter. WhatA>Wll you do if the motor stopsiwhen youA>Wre doing loops half a mile up?A>[iiIt was Poke who made answer. A>ZHuh! What good would a self-starter do?A>[iiA>ZWell, IA>Wd hate to have to get out of the seat and try to walk aroundion air and crank up,A>[ Orkney pointed out.iiPoke reddened. A>ZMuch you fellows know about flying! Of course you canA>Wtiwalk around on air, and rest wrenches on clouds, or crawl under theimachine to see whatA>Ws wrong! You donA>Wt do things that way.A>[iiA>ZWell, what _do_ you do?A>[iiA>ZGive us a dress rehearsal,A>[ suggested the Trojan.iiA>ZI will!A>[ cried Poke excitedly, and climbed to the seat of theiSaracenA>Ws driver. There he settled himself, swiftly tested a brace ofilevers, twanged the wire braces experimentally, and nodded to Step.iiA>ZWind her up!A>[ he ordered. A>ZWeA>Wll show A>Wem a thing or two.A>[iiStep seized the crank, willingly enough.iiA>ZSay, donA>Wt forget, Poke, to advance the spark,A>[ jeered Herman.iiA>ZHuh! ItA>Ws kept that way!A>[ snapped Poke.iiStep spun the crank, and the furious barking of the motor began again.iIndeed, it was louder than before and the reports came with muchigreater frequency. The propeller revolved with a speed which made theiblades melt into a sort of hazy halo. The anchor rope tautened. Soigreat was the strain that, to SamA>Ws anxious eye, the line seemed toishrink.iiA>ZHold on! ThatA>Ws enough!A>[ he shouted, but the thunder of theimufflerless motor drowned his voice. He turned to his companions--andicaught sight of the Shark, approaching at a run and wildly waving aisheet of paper above his head.iiThen Poke did something--none of the onlookers knew just what; eveniStep later had to confess ignorance. But the something was followed byian increase in the furious roaring of the motor. The whirling bladesiof the propeller spun madly. The anchor line vibrated like a fiddleistring. Then, suddenly, it parted with a report audible even in thatifrightful tumult.iiThe Saracen shot forward, gliding with swiftly increasing speed oniits bicycle wheels. There was a slight slope to accelerate its start,ithough, truth to tell, there seemed to be no need of such help. Theiboys saw Poke making strange motions, tugging vainly at the levers, asihe dashed away on such a ride as had never entered into even the dreamsiof any of them.iiThe Shark came up, breathless with haste. He caught SamA>Ws arm, andistared dazedly at the departing machine.iiA>ZStop him, somebody!A>[ he gasped. A>ZJust--just worked it out. WhatA>Wd youilet Poke go for before I told him? That--that thing wonA>Wt fly!A>[iiiiiCHAPTER XV THE DASH OF THE SCARY HENiiiNothing had been further from PokeA>Ws intention than such a wild ride asithat in which he now found himself engaged.iiAll he had proposed was a sort of A>Zdock trialA>[--to use an expressionihe had once employed in talking with Sam; but now, to his bewildermentiand alarm, he was going to sea, so to speak. Great pains had beenitaken in the adjustment of the bicycle wheels under the plane, andiMaster Mechanic Step had been proud of their smooth running on theiriball-bearings. Indeed, so well had friction been reduced that theiSaracen could be wheeled about easily; but now it was all too evidentithat the wheeling by engine power was also easily accomplished. Theipush of the swiftly-whirling propeller and the slope was producing aimost effective combination. The Saracen shot away from the anchorage asian arrow shoots from a bow, and then bettered the performance of anyiarrow by traveling faster and faster as it advanced.iiPoke did his best to stop the machine--and failed signally. Perhaps inithe haste of his surprise he lost his head for a moment, and managedito do the wrong thing; perhaps--and this is quite as probable--theifault lay in the mechanism. The devices for controlling the engine andithe wings were still in the experimental stage; and, as it happened,iwere really more the products of StepA>Ws ingenuity than of PokeA>Ws.iUnchallenged credit for the basic idea of a flying machine belongedito the latter, but practical working out of the plans had fallen moreiand more to his partner in the enterprise; and StepA>Ws way of doingithings was not likely to be anybody elseA>Ws way. Moreover, StepA>Wsiextraordinarily long arms and legs gave him a reach for which pudgyiPoke could not hope; and all the levers and controls were adjustedito StepA>Ws liking. Sitting in the saddle, Poke was unable to touchicertain cords of high importance in the general scheme of navigationiof the craft; his feet swung clear of pedals, also essential to itsimanagement. As for the levers upon which he laid hold--well, theyiwouldnA>Wt work, at least, as he wished them to work. The net result ofihis early endeavors seemed to be merely a further quickening of theialready terrifying speed of motor and propeller and of the pace of theiSaracen.iiThe aircraft dashed down the gentle slope almost as a toboggan mightislip down its chute; though its motion had a curiously buoyant qualityino toboggan could claim. It was riding such as Poke had never beforeiknown. The broad planes seemed to lift it smoothly and lightly over theiirregularities in the turf of the field. It swayed, to be sure, butithere was something easy and graceful in the lateral motion; somethingialmost birdlike, something which roused PokeA>Ws hope and ambition, onceihis first panic passed and he discovered that he was not only stillialive but also unharmed. He hadnA>Wt intended to try to fly that day, butithe feeling of A>ZliftA>[ was undeniably luring. He thought of the doubtingiThomases who were watching his performance. He reached decision. HeA>Wdishow A>Wem, and show A>Wem then and there!iiHe bent forward. Again he seized the levers, by which he expected toishift his planes for the rise clear of earth. He tugged valiantly.iNothing happened. He threw all his strength into another effort--andisomething did happen! Nothing but the back of the seat saved him fromitumbling bodily from the machine, as one of the bars of wood brokeishort off under the strain.iiPoke recovered his balance by a mighty effort. Also he strove to keepihis wits about him. Plainly, he could not fly. Seemingly, he could notistop the motor. It was behind him, and placed low down in a peculiarlyiinaccessible spot. Even the long-limbed Step, in cranking it, had beeniforced almost to crawl under the machine, while as for reaching it fromithe seat--that was wholly out of the question. The so-called safetyidevices of StepA>Ws contrivance were out of commission. Poke, summarizingihis situation, set his jaw stubbornly. If he couldnA>Wt fly and couldnA>Wtistop, he might at least be able to steer the Saracen and circle the bigifield to the edification of all beholders; and trust to luck to haltithe motor sooner or later.ii[Illustration: POKE CLUNG TO HIS SEAT]iiNow, the SaracenA>Ws rudder might have been mightily effective inimid-air--this was a matter fated to be left in uncertainty--but it wasipoorly calculated to guide a runaway machine on the ground. It was aismall trailing plane, set vertically. PokeA>Ws attempts to adjust it wereiin vain, at least so far as securing the desired effect. The Saracenimerely lurched to one side; then swung back, dipping its wing deeply;iregained an even keel, but began to zigzag in most distressing fashion.iPoke again was almost thrown from his seat, and was glad to cling forisupport to the uprights of the framework. The truth burst upon him thatihe was purely a passenger on this amazing voyage of his.iiEvery voyage has to end. Poke began to wonder most apprehensivelyihow this would end. He had read accounts of tremendous speed made byiice-sleds equipped with propellers working in air; but, of course, theibig field was not an icy expanse. The pace he was making suggestediice-records--at least, to his fancy--but so far it had been due in partito the slope. Just before him was an almost level stretch. Then cameia slight rise, to a low stone wall bordering the road. It occurred toihim that it would be very evil fortune to strike that wall.iiIt must be understood that things had been happening very rapidly foriPoke, and very little time had elapsed since he shot away from hisifriends. It was a mere matter of seconds till he was crossing theilevel, and beginning to mount the low ridge. There was a diminution ofispeed, but it was not a marked diminution; and he saw with terror thatithe SaracenA>Ws momentum would not be checked before the wall was reached.iiThen, in hot haste, he did anything and everything he could in aidesperate, last chance effort. But the engine roared as violently andirapidly as ever; indeed, he seemed to have contrived to rouse theiancient mechanism to a frenzy of energy. The planes dipped and roseiwith the swaying of the monster. There was a queer, sidewise lunge;ithen, swiftly, a bewildering change. A thrill ran through Poke. Of aisudden, the motion of the craft had become smooth, buoyant, marvelouslyiexhilarating. The vibration of the motor remained, but there was noilonger the jar of wheels on uneven ground. He could still see theithreatening wall, but it was no longer before him, barring the way.iIt was beneath him. He was vaulting it with a dozen feet to spare. TheiSaracen was flying!iiThat second was like no other Poke had known.iiWonderful elation filled him. Forgotten in the glorious instant wereihis past labors and the uncertainties of his immediate future. Whereiwere the doubters and scoffers now? What wouldnA>Wt the most cynical andipessimistic among them give to be able to share that triumph of flightiachieved! His faith was justified; StepA>Ws ingenuity was confirmed byipractical performance. The Saracen was in flight!iiNo dream of PokeA>Ws had ever been more delightful--and no dream couldiend more speedily than this fleeting jubilation.iiThe Saracen had risen; now the Saracen fell. In truth, the machineA>Wsiperformance suggested a tremendous bound rather than soaring; andiPoke hardly had grasped the amazing fact that he was going up beforeithe equally important circumstance was impressed upon him that heiwas coming down. There was nothing for him to do. He was merelyia passenger. He was aware of a sharp swerve of course to theileft. Instead of a high barrier of trees before him, there was aniopening--and the opening was the highway. By sheer good fortune theichange of direction in mid-air had saved him from crashing into theifurther bank, and had brought him into the road leading toward theilake. He felt the jar as the wheels again touched the ground, and cameito understanding of what was happening, even if he had no clear notioniof how it had been brought about. As by a miracle he was in the road,iand traveling at a great pace, the gentle slope of the country lakewardidoing its part in promoting his sensational progress.iiAnd what a startling performance it was! Picture a quiet country road,iof a sudden invaded by a fiercely panting monster, a sort of wingedidragon, rushing along in a tumult of uproar and stirring dense cloudsiof dust in its passage; the tips of its wings brushing the trees onieither hand. Poke, deafened by the whir of the propeller and the savageidetonations of the motor, clung to his seat and closed his eyes thatihe might not behold the perils lurking in his path. What would happeniif he met a heavily loaded wagon, or overtook one of the big trucksicarrying lumber to the new settlement? Or suppose some rash motoristiwas speeding toward him! Suppose----iiBut there was no need to worry himself with conjectures. The real thingiimpended. Something made him open his eyes. A big touring car wasiturning a bend in the road just ahead of him. In a flash he recognizedithe man at the wheel--Lon Gates. In another, he was aware that by someimarvel of dextrous steering Lon had shot his car into the ditch, thatithe SaracenA>Ws wing was grazing his head, that by a miracle a collisionihad been avoided. Poke couldnA>Wt have seen it, but, somehow, he knewithat Lon, wide-eyed with amazement, was staring after the swirl of dustiin which the strange chariot was roaring along.iiWhat Lon said Poke couldnA>Wt know. But the words were these:iiA>ZJee-whillikens and Jupiter crickets! Talk about a Scary Hen! A millioniold biddies cacklinA>W and runninA>W from a hen hawk wouldnA>Wt be a markerito that there crazy road rioter! But whatA>Ws Poke thinkinA>W heA>Ws tryinA>Wito do? And whereA>Ws he supposed to be headinA>W for? Way heA>Ws takinA>W upithe whole road and then a leetle more heA>Ws bound to have trouble and aiheap of it mighty quick and enthusiastic! Guess IA>Wd better be follerinA>Wialong, soA>Ws to be able to help pick up the pieces.A>[iiAnd with that Lon threw on his power, turned the big car about, andihurried in the hazy wake of the Saracen.iiPoke, meanwhile, was continuing his wild ride, keeping the road byisome freak of fortune. The slight but steady fall in the grade wasimaking amends for any eccentricities of conduct on the part of theiancient motor, which, it must be confessed, was beginning to betrayisome of its weaknesses. It was missing fire now and then; but,icuriously, the breaks seemed to make the uproar all the greater andimore ear-splitting. It sufficed, at any rate, to give warning of hisiapproach to a woman, who had been driving tranquilly toward town. Poke,isweeping along, had a glimpse of a frightened horse plunging throughia wayside thicket, of a white-faced driver plying a whip frantically,iof a buggy careening dizzily. Then his second escape from collisionihad been made and he was dashing through woods, and praying that theisidewise plunge he believed to be inevitable would not come until heiwas again in open country.iiThe snorting of his motor was more irregular--and a bit moreiterrifying. The whir of the propeller appeared to grow shriller. TheiA>ZliftA>[ of the machine was less noticeable. One wing, indeed, hadisuffered much damage at its tip by contact with branches, and on theiother side there was an observable sag of the planes. Something hadigone wrong astern--just what the trouble was he could not discover. Notithat it mattered, though. By this time he was ready enough to let theiSaracen go to the scrap-heap, if only he could escape with his life.iiHe was coming, now, to the border of the wooded tract. Through theitrees to the left he had brief sight of the gleaming blue water of aniarm of the lake. At that his courage rose a bit. He could swim. If theimachine ended its runaway career in the depths, he would fare wellienough, if he could avoid going down with the ship. It behooved him toimake sure that he would not be caught by parts of the machine if heitried to jump. He bent forward, he strove for firmer footing on theicross braces. And then----iiThe ending of the SaracenA>Ws dash was as sudden as its beginning. Ailurch to the right was not followed by recovery. Instead, the machineiheld its new course, left the beaten track of the road, plunged intoia tangle of undergrowth, which served as an efficient, if painful,ibrake. Thorns raked PokeA>Ws arms and tore his clothes, just as branchesiripped the planes to ribbons and saplings, bending before the machineA>Wsicharge, yet contrived to check it. The broken roar of the motor ceased;ithe whir of the propeller died away. In a second or two the monster ofithe road was stripped of all terrors, and lay in the midst of a tanglediheap of debris, half contributed by its own parts and half by the brushiand vines it had uprooted.iiPoke had pitched forward from his saddle. Indeed, it was as if a giantiarm had picked him up and tossed him bodily through another clump ofidense undergrowth--and thereby supplied him with a sort of naturalishock absorber. There was a tremendous cracking and crashing of smallibranches and twigs; and from the farther side of the thicket Pokeirolled out upon the ground, shaken from head to foot, bleeding from aiscore of scratches, his garments fit only for the rag-bag. Yet almostimiraculously he had escaped serious harm. Not a bone was broken. Heimight be sore and aching from forehead to toe, but all his wounds wereisuperficial. He could raise himself on hands and knees, and this heidid. Instead, though, of attempting to get upon his feet, he remainedias he was for a moment, staring in amazement at the sight which met hisieyes.iiPoke, as it happened, had been catapulted into a tableau, so to speak,iin which Zorn and Hagle figured. Apparently, the noisy approach of theiSaracen had interrupted Zorn in the process of disciplining the smalleriboy; for he still held Hagle by the collar, while with his victim heigazed spellbound at the picture presented by Poke in the r"rle of theihuman projectile.iiiiiCHAPTER XVI ZORN SHOWS HIS TEETH AGAINiiiIt occurred to Poke, subsequently, that his appearance on the sceneiproduced upon Zorn and Hagle an effect even more marked than might beiaccounted for by the extraordinary manner of his approach. The pairiwere not merely startled; there was an alarm, a consternation hintingiat something more than surprise or fear of physical harm. It was odd,itoo, that they seemed to have difficulty in finding tongue; and it wasiPoke who spoke first.iiA>ZHul--hulloo, there!A>[ he said, faintly.iiNeither answered. Zorn gave a start, and Hagle cowered like a whippedidog; but the lips of neither moved.iiWith some difficulty Poke got upon his feet.iiA>ZHul--hulloo!A>[ he repeated. A>ZSay, but you fellows must be thinking ailot to say so little!A>[iiAt that Zorn, with a warning glance at Hagle, loosed his grip on theilatterA>Ws collar.iiA>ZEh? Say so little? ThereA>Ws a lot to say and ask.A>[ Zorn, having foundihis tongue, could employ it briskly. A>ZGreat Scott! but what have youibeen up to? You come smashing into us, almost, and then want to knowiwhy we donA>Wt make speeches? Look here! What have you been doing? Whatiin the name of all crazy cats is that thing you were riding on?A>[iiPoke turned to glance ruefully at the wreck of the Saracen.iiA>ZOh, that? ThatA>Ws a--a--er--er--thatA>Ws a machine IA>Wve been foolingiwith.A>[iiA>ZUmph! Looks more as if it had fooled with you.A>[ Zorn came forward, andigazed with undisguised interest at the ruin. A>ZUmph! Guess I know whatithis is--or was. Somebody tipped me off the other day that you wereimonkeying with a flying machine. But I didnA>Wt think you had gumption toido anything with it. But you didnA>Wt fly here, did you?A>[iiA>ZNot exactly,A>[ Poke told him with a degree of dignity. A>ZI--I--well, Iicame on wheels, as you might say.A>[iiA>ZBut--but you arenA>Wt hurt, are you?A>[ Hagle asked tremulously.iiA>ZNo; not to speak of.A>[iiA>ZIA>Wm glad of that!A>[ said Hagle so heartily that Poke glanced at himiwonderingly.iiZorn scowled, and kicked at a broken plane. A>ZYouA>Wre lucky to save yourineck!A>[ he growled. A>ZFunny the things that donA>Wt kill idiots! But if youiarenA>Wt damaged, this contraption of yours is, all right! Mighty fewipieces left to put together, I should say!A>[iiPoke was relieved of the need of making reply; for just then Lon Gatesicame upon the scene, having left his automobile in the road. It tookihim but an instant to grasp the situation.iiA>ZWell, I guess youA>Wve done it now,A>[ he remarked, having satisfiedihimself that Poke had come to no great harm. A>ZWay you was scootinA>Wialong--you and your Scary Hen--say, but you was jest playinA>W tag withithe high places! And as for monopolizinA>W things--son, I never see suchia road-hog as you was. You wanted everything between the fences, and byijiminy, you was takinA>W it! But IA>Wd kinder like to know the end oA>W theistory. What happened in the last chapter?A>[iiA>ZI donA>Wt know exactly,A>[ Poke confessed. A>ZIt--it ended mighty suddenly.A>[iiA>ZBut it didnA>Wt end you--thatA>Ws the main pA>Wint.A>[iiA>ZNo; IA>Wm all right,A>[ said Poke pluckily. A little stream of blood wasitrickling from a gash in his cheek. He wiped it away with his sleeve.iHagle stepped up to him, and pulling out his handkerchief, fell toidabbing at the wound. It was a most kindly meant attention, but Pokeishrank back, in embarrassment. And Lon came to the rescue.iiA>ZWell, I guess I may have to find you a barrel to go home in. Themipants oA>W yourn is what an artist feller I know would call sorteriimpressionistic. But, seeinA>W as how you ainA>Wt killed, I dunnoA>Ws thereA>Wsiany great cause for complaint. And now, with your kind permission, IA>Wllitake a peek at the remains oA>W the Scary Hen.A>[iiA>ZScary Hen!A>[ Zorn repeated, and laughed jeeringly. Nobody, however,ipaid any attention to him. Poke, closely observed by the pitying Hagle,iinspected his scratched hands and rent garments. Lon made the circuitiof the wrecked flying machine, uttering an exclamation now and then asihe came upon fresh evidence of the completeness of its ruin. And whileithese things were doing, Sam and the rest of the club, panting fromitheir long run in pursuit of the Saracen, came up.iiBroken and hurried queries rained upon Poke, but resulted in slightiincrease in the general stock of knowledge.iiA>ZI donA>Wt know what was the matter; I guess everything was,A>[ heideclared. A>ZNothing worked right. The controls wouldnA>Wt control, and theirudder wouldnA>Wt steer, and the safety things werenA>Wt safe. So I----A>[iiA>ZHold on there!A>[ Step broke in. He strode up to Poke and shook a fingeriin his face. A>ZDonA>Wt you go to blaming the apparatus! It was you--youidid it all!A>[iiA>ZEh? I--_I_ did it? Why, I----A>[iiA>ZYes you did!A>[ cried Step, hotly. A>ZYou ought to have known that none ofithe rigging was really ready, and the safety device was disconnected,iand----A>[iiA>ZYou didnA>Wt tell me that, and you let me risk my life!A>[ shouted Poke inia rage.iiA>ZHowA>Wd I know youA>Wd gone crazy?A>[iiA>ZMe crazy!A>[iiA>ZHuh! You look it.A>[iiA>ZDo I? Then itA>Ws your fault! If you hadnA>Wt been making your fooliexperiments and monkeying with things that were all right, I wouldnA>Wtibe in this fix or the Saracen, either. But IA>Wll show you!A>[iiA>ZDo it--if youA>Wre man enough!A>[ taunted Step, in a fury at theiaspersions cast on his mechanical skill.iiPoke needed no second invitation. He hurled his ragged and grimy selfiat his partner, who, on his side, met the charge half-way. There wasia wild exchange of unaimed blows, and then they came to a clinch. Samisprang forward. So did Orkney. By their united efforts they separatedithe combatants and dragged them apart.iiA>ZStop this scrapping!A>[ Sam commanded, with a gruffness which was notilessened by knowledge that Zorn was grinning widely at the spectacle ofidiscord in the club.iiA>ZQuit it!A>[ Orkney ordered, still more curtly.iiA>ZThen make him take back what he said,A>[ Step protested.iiA>ZItA>Ws true!A>[ shrilled Poke. A>ZWay he left everything, A>Wtwas like tryingito drive a horse without reins or bridle!A>[iiA>ZThen you ought to have known enough not to try to ride the Saracen,A>[iStep countered.iiA>ZYou didnA>Wt tell me.A>[iiA>ZWhy didnA>Wt you have sense enough to ask? If youA>Wd had your eyes openias wide as your mouth----A>[iiTwo things helped to end this abusive debate. One was the action ofiSam and Orkney, each of whom shook his captive, not too gently. Theiother was the appearance of adult investigators of the disaster to theiSaracen. A runabout came to a stop in the road, and two men, leavingithe car, crossed to the group.iiA>ZWhew! This looks like the end of a real joy ride!A>[ said the leader ofithe pair. A>ZSmashed, and smashed for fair! But what kind of a----Say,iZorn!A>[ he turned to his companion, a stout, middle-aged man. A>ZBy theigreat horn spoon, but hereA>Ws whatA>Ws left of a make of machine thatibeats my time!A>[iiMr. Zorn ran his eye over the tangle of planes and machinery.iiA>ZFor a guess itA>Ws a flyer of some sort. But whereA>Ws the aeronaut?A>[iiPoke, released by Sam, stepped forward. A>ZI--well, I was running it, oritrying to run it, sir. And--and--well, things miscued, somehow.A>[iiA>ZBut did it fly?A>[iiA>ZYes, sir, it did--once. And it moved a whole lot.A>[iiFrom the other side of the wreck Lon contributed his bit: A>ZSpeakinA>W oA>WimovinA>W, this affair made me think of a canal boat--A>Wtwas so different.A>[iiMr. Zorn smiled. A>ZWell, thereA>Ws evidence enough here that it didnA>Wtiprecisely crawl through the bushes. But nobodyA>Ws killed, I infer.A>[iiA>ZNot permanently,A>[ chuckled Lon. A>ZStill, clothes suffered--yes, clothesiand feelinA>Ws. Pretty solid bump at the last, you see.A>[iiA>ZSo I imagine,A>[ said Mr. Zorn. A>ZLucky the motor didnA>Wt set theiscrap-heap afire. But it must have been quite a machine to start with.A>[iAnd with that he began an observation tour about the Saracen, very muchias Lon had made one. His companion appeared to be less interested;ifor, after fidgeting for a moment, he called out, impatiently:iiA>ZLetA>Ws be getting along, Zorn! ThereA>Ws nothing we can do here, andiweA>Wll be late for our appointment, as it is.A>[iiMr. Zorn turned, and walked toward his car; but Sam, reminded of theierrand he had proposed to do, quickly overtook him.iiA>ZCan you give me a minute, sir?A>[ he asked. A>ZItA>Ws about the camp--theiplace where weA>Wve pitched a tent, I mean. We hear that it is on youriland, and weA>Wd like to get permission to stay there, or rent a littleiground, or--or do whatever you think right.A>[iiEd Zorn had followed Sam. A>ZItA>Ws the squatter business I told youiabout,A>[ he said to his father, meaningly. A>ZA whole crowd has moved in,ibag and baggage.A>[iiA>ZOh!A>[ said Mr. Zorn; his tone was not encouraging. A>ZSo youA>Wre theicamping party, eh? H-m-m! I donA>Wt know about it, young man. The woodsiare mighty dry, and a little carelessness might cost me a pretty penny.A>[iiA>ZWeA>Wll be careful,A>[ Sam urged. A>ZWe understand the danger of starting aibrush fire.A>[iiA>ZUmph!A>[ said Mr. Zorn doubtfully.iiA>ZBut weA>Wll promise----A>[iiA>ZWhat good are promises?A>[ Ed interrupted.iiThere he made a mistake. A>ZI think I can attend to my own affairs,A>[ hisifather said testily. A>ZSuppose you devote yourself to your own, Ed.A>[iThen he turned to Sam. A>ZIA>Wm not ready to say yes or no, definitely.iIA>Wll have to have a look at your place first. It isnA>Wt a matter ofirental, but is a matter of safety; I want to see how you are doingithings. IA>Wll come over in a day or two.A>[iiA>ZThank you, sir,A>[ said Sam.iiA>ZUmph! Better wait for results,A>[ quoth Mr. Zorn drily, and resumed hisimarch to the runabout, in which his companion was already seated.iiAs the little car shot away, Ed Zorn caught Sam, roughly, by theishoulder.iiA>ZLook here! YouA>Wll pay for this!A>[ he cried. A>ZYou may think you can getiaround my father with your slick palavering, but it wonA>Wt work. Youricase will be attended to, soon enough!A>[iiSam shook himself free. A>ZKeep your hands off me, Zorn!A>[ he saidisharply.iiA>ZHuh! LetA>Ws see you make me keep A>Wem off!A>[iiA>ZIA>Wm ready to try. Get that straight--IA>Wm ready to try, right now!A>[iiSamA>Ws voice was not raised, but there was a note in it that hinted atireadiness to meet trouble half-way. Truth to tell, the head of theiSafety First Club was beginning to feel the time was ripe for theipersonal reckoning he meant to have with this enemy.iiZornA>Ws face darkened. He cast a swift glance at the other boys in theibackground, and shook his head.iiA>ZNo; IA>Wm no fool,A>[ he declared. A>ZIA>Wd take you on and never bat anieyelash, but you and your whole gang, all at once? No. IA>Wll attend toiyou later on, when you havenA>Wt all your heelers along.A>[iiA>ZI promise you they wonA>Wt interfere.A>[iiZorn snapped his fingers. A>ZThat for your promises!

A>ZBosh! YouA>Wve been doing us all the harm youican.A>[iiOddly enough, Zorn laughed in return, but the laugh had no mirth in it.iA>ZThink so, do you? Well, youA>Wll have a chance to change that opinion.iI tell you----A>[ Then he checked himself, and called to Hagle, who hadibeen hovering near by. A>ZHere, Jack, come along! Say! get a move on,icanA>Wt you?A>[iiHagle obeyed, though with an air of reluctance.iiA>ZEr--er--good-bye, you fellows,A>[ he quavered, and shuffled after Zorn,iwho already was striding away.iiiiiCHAPTER XVII SAM HEADS A FISHING PARTYiiiEver since Lon had recited the tale of Old Man FreemanA>Ws William Troutihe had been much importuned by the boys for information about theistream in which the big fish lived and grew mighty. He had chosen toimake a great mystery of the matter, but under repeated questioning hadidropped a hint here and spoken an inadvertent word there, until Sam,iputting one thing with another, was able not only to form an opinion ofithe direction in which the brook lay, but also to make a shrewd guessiat the whereabouts of the hermitA>Ws cabin, or what might be left of it.iiSam had been planning an expedition of exploration and discovery, andithe disaster to the Saracen quickened his purpose. Poke took the wreckivery much to heart. In imagination he had pictured himself sailingigaily above the heads of admiring crowds; but, to do him justice,ihe had counted more upon the money returns of his enterprise thaniupon the attendant glory. Poke was a thoroughly honest chap, and itiirked him to be in debt. He had hoped to repay his friends, and nowithat hope was dissipated, to say nothing of sundry new obligationsiincurred in the construction of the airplane. Naturally, therefore, heiwas temporarily taking a gloomy view of life, and was in sore need ofisoothing diversions.iiStep, too, was grieved by the calamity, though his disappointment wasinot so keen. After all, he was not the originator of the Great Idea;ithat melancholy honor belonged exclusively to Poke. Hence, when he hadireached a more amicable understanding with his partner in regard to theicondition of the SaracenA>Ws gear, it was easier for him to take the viewithat there was no virtue in shedding tears over spilt milk. But Step asiwell as Poke would be the better for new interests, Sam decided; andiquest of the Freeman brook suggested a desirable opportunity.iiMr. Zorn had spoken of inspecting the camp in a day or two, but theiweek wore away with no word from him. On Friday afternoon the club, inifull force, hiked to the lake, prepared to remain there until Mondayimorning, when Lon was to appear with the big car and whisk them backito town in time for school. The evening passed pleasantly and quietly,itheir nightA>Ws rest was undisturbed, and early Saturday morning Samimarshaled the clan for the march across country. All carried fishingitackle, though it was admitted that angling would be a mere incident ofithe day.iiA>ZI donA>Wt know just how far weA>Wre going, but IA>Wve got a general idea ofithe direction,A>[ Sam told the others, who appeared to be willing enoughito follow his lead and take chances. So they set out, with Sam at theihead of the straggling line, laying his course in part by aid of aipocket compass he carried, and in part by certain landmarks known toiall of them.iiThe route scorned roads, mostly, crossing fields and woods, climbingilow hills and dipping into little valleys, edging away from the lakeiand carrying the party into a region with which they had slightiacquaintance. They passed a few farmhouses, but most of the time wereiout of sight of habitations; for the country thereabouts was thinlyisettled. The pace was leisurely. The boys had all day before them, andithere was plenty of opportunity for Sam to have a confidential word oritwo, now with one of his friends and then with another.iiOrkney, for example, was beginning to worry about the Trojan, inicoaching whom he had been especially active of late.iiA>ZItA>Ws getting harder to keep him up to the mark,A>[ he explained. A>ZNo; IidonA>Wt call it a case of quitting--itA>Ws more of a case of not caring.iYou see, down at bottom the Trojan feels that he wasnA>Wt given a squareideal, and the thing rankles. He appreciates the trouble the club isitaking for him, and has tried to do his part; but, somehow, heA>Ws noireal heart for the job. He doesnA>Wt care--thereA>Ws the rub; and that sortiof thing makes a difference, when youA>Wre in for a long pull like thisione. Oh, I guess heA>Wll stick it out in a way--go through the motions,ianyway, you know--but if weA>Wre to hold him with the class, thereA>Ws gotito be something to spur him up, and itA>Ws got to come pretty quickly.A>[iiSam nodded, and his expression grew serious. His opinion was much likeiTomA>Ws. The Trojan needed a mental bracer of some sort, but how it wasito be found he could not conjecture. As for himself, he had Lon asicounselor in seasons of depression, but Lon had not tried to deal withiWalker.iiThen Tom fell back, and presently Poke drew up with the leader.iHe was still in his mood of depression, and Sam had to make talkiwithout marked response for a time. At last, though, Poke showed someianimation. Curiously, it was mention of Jack Hagle which stirred him.iiA>ZItA>Ws a funny thing to say,A>[ he remarked, A>Zand maybe youA>Wll think I wasijarred off my trolley, but when the machine crashed into the bushes andiI came that cropper through them, what impressed me most was the wayiZorn and Hagle acted. Now, so far as the suddenness of it went, I mightihave dropped a couple of miles from the clouds; but that pair behavedias if the thing that bothered A>Wem was not the question whether I wasikilled or not, but how much I noticed of the thrashing Zorn was givingiJack. I figure if they were so anxious I shouldnA>Wt know about it that,isomehow, we were mixed up in whatever caused their row.A>[iiA>ZIsnA>Wt that rather a far-fetched notion?A>[iiA>ZIt might be, if Zorn wasnA>Wt in the game. That fellowA>Wd do anything!iAnd he has Hagle completely under his thumb.A>[iiA>ZItA>Ws true,A>[ Sam admitted. A>ZAnd itA>Ws true, too, that Hagle has shown aisort of friendliness for us once or twice.A>[iiPoke wagged his head sagely. A>ZI tell you, Sam! Mark my words, Hagleiknows something about that business of the TrojanA>Ws, and itA>Ws worryingihim! And Zorn is terrorizing him, to keep him quiet.A>[iiA>ZBut----A>[ Sam began.iiA>ZBut what?A>[iiA>ZBut Zorn said he could clear the slate for us, and I donA>Wt think heA>Wdido it by incriminating himself.A>[iiA>ZNeither would Hagle, would he?A>[iiA>ZIt may not sound reasonable, but he might, I think--that is, heA>Wd beimore likely than Zorn to weaken.A>[iiA>ZBut it was Zorn who spread all the stories through the school. And itiwas Zorn who cooked up things at the class meeting.A>[iiA>ZI admit that. I also admit I donA>Wt understand the situation, so far asithose fellows are concerned.A>[iiA>ZI donA>Wt either,A>[ said Poke. A>ZIA>Wm perfectly sure, though, theyA>Wreiboth in the scheme, somehow. And it almost startled both of A>Wem out ofia yearA>Ws growth to see me shooting at them through the bushes. Beyondithat itA>Ws all guesswork with me.A>[iiA>ZSame here,A>[ Sam agreed, thoughtfully.iiJust then Herman Boyd overtook the leaders and interrupted their talk.iHerman was beginning to be skeptical about SamA>Ws mental mapping of theibrook; and one or two of the others expressed doubts as the hours woreiaway. Sam, however, maintained unruffled composure. He might be wrong,ibut even if he were wrong, no harm would be done; and so he held hisiway, declined to halt beside any of the little streams they crossed,iand at last pointed out a brook of considerable size, flowing through aivalley which was like a gash in the hills.iiA>ZThatA>Ws it--or itA>Ws my guess, anyway,A>[ he said. A>ZAnd I think FreemanA>Wsicabin and the pool are a little higher up.A>[iiPoke proposed a halt for luncheon before pursuing their explorations,iand the idea met with favor. It was well after noon when theiribaskets had been emptied, and the quest was resumed. Again the partyistraggled. It was a go-as-you-please stroll for everybody. Sam andithe Shark, who cared little for fishing, were in the van, the othersipausing now and then to drop a hook, though with small reward foritheir trouble. Probably an hour slipped away before Sam came to a pooligenerally answering LonA>Ws description of the home of William Trout, andisome time passed before his followers began to overtake him. Meanwhile,iwith the SharkA>Ws aid, he had been searching for the site of the cabin;iand had come upon traces of a building of some sort. Evidently thereihad been a fire, and after that the woods had come in, so that it wasiby no means easy to estimate the size of the building which once hadistood there.iiThe Shark was not greatly impressed, nor was he inclined to regard theiproof as positive.iiA>ZHuh! Maybe itA>Ws the place, and, then again, maybe it isnA>Wt. May haveibeen a farmhouse that was abandoned; may have been somebodyA>Ws camp.A>[iiA>ZAnd so it may have been Old Man FreemanA>Ws,A>[ Sam pointed out.iiThe Shark shrugged. A>ZHuh! A>VMaybeA>W doesnA>Wt get you anywhere. I donA>Wtitake much stock in these calculations with no given quantities. And Lonimay have been fooling you.A>[iiA>ZI donA>Wt think so,A>[ said Sam. A>ZLon likes to make a good story, butiweA>Wve always found some basis for his yarns.A>[iiA>ZSame as there was basis for PokeA>Ws Saracen, eh? I could have told him,ioffhand, that heA>Wd get enough push from his propeller to trundle himidown-hill, but I had to do a lot of precise calculation to find outithat he couldnA>Wt fly far.A>[iiIt was on the tip of SamA>Ws tongue to remind the mathematician that hisiexact knowledge was reached a trifle late to save Poke from disaster,ibut he refrained from controversy. Step and the Trojan came along;ithen Orkney and Poke. Sam pointed out the ruins; there was animatedidiscussion. The majority stood with Sam, and opined that pool and cabinisite had been found. Then arrived Herman, highly excited and displayingia ten-inch trout he had caught a quarter-mile down-stream. In a jiffyithe anglers were scattered along the brook, fishing as for dear life.iiGiven half a dozen healthy youngsters making holiday, you have aicombination which does not make for haste. No more trout were taken,ibut much time was occupied. The afternoon was half gone, when Sam,ireminded of the long tramp home, called the clan together.iiAs was to be expected, there was less fun and more work about theireturn journey. Partly for variety and partly because he believedihe could save distance, Sam chose a new route, a short cut, as heisupposed, and one taking advantage of a long stretch of country road.iThe grass growing between the wheel tracks showed that it was not muchitraveled, but when the boys had followed it for some distance they metia farmer jogging leisurely homeward. From him they learned that theyiwere still far from the lake--or the A>Zpond,A>[ as he preferred to call it.iiA>ZItA>Ws risinA>W three mile,A>[ he said. A>ZShortest wayA>Wll be for you to stickito the road till you come to a steepish hill off to the left. Climb it,iand youA>Wll be able to see an end of the pond--that is, if the woodsiainA>Wt growed up soA>Ws to hide it. I hainA>Wt been sightseeinA>W for a goodiwhile, and I donA>Wt know whether the water shows or not.A>[iiSam thanked him for the directions. The A>Zsteepish hill,A>[ in fact, wasione of the landmarks by which he intended to steer, and as the hike wasiresumed, he kept a sharp lookout for the abrupt slopes. Estimates ofidistance, though, are seldom accurate, and the boys had tramped on forifully an hour before the hill was reached. From its top the lake wasinot visible, the woods having grown sufficiently to hide the water, butiSam had no difficulty in placing the depression in which it lay. Butilake and camp were still far away, three or four miles at the least.iiThere was a little mild grumbling.iiA>ZHuh! Guess you must have taken the longest way A>Wround, Sam,A>[ Pokeisuggested.iiA>ZGee, but I feel as if my legs were doing double duty!A>[ Poke chimed in.iiA>ZThatA>Ws because youA>Wre built for low gear, Poke,A>[ chuckled Herman.iiA>ZLow gear yourself!A>[ snapped the plump youth. A>ZIA>Wm built on modernilines--regular safety bicycle idea. You fellows are like the old-styleihigh wheels--all show and headers!A>[iiSomething in the distance had caught OrkneyA>Ws attention, and he wasistudying it intently.iiA>ZWhatA>Ws that yonder--low down; just above the tree tops; sort ofihanging over them? Think itA>Ws a dust cloud?A>[iiThere was a thin haze in the air, more suggestive of autumn than ofilate spring. It faintly blurred the horizon, but Sam could make out theithickening, so to speak, to which Tom referred.iiA>ZDust?A>[ he repeated. A>ZI donA>Wt know. Might be, of course, but----A>[iiA>ZBut it looks to me more like smoke,A>[ the Trojan interrupted.iiA>ZThatA>Ws my idea, too,A>[ said Sam sharply.iiHe started at a rapid pace down the hill, and his club-mates hurriediafter him.iiiiiCHAPTER XVIII THE CLUB TURNS FIRE BRIGADEiiiIt was not a thin haze now, but a blurring gray curtain, halficoncealing the woods before which it hung. A pungent odor filled theiair, which had, too, a curiously irritating, smarting quality, tryingiand painful to eyes and lungs. The boys, panting from their forcedimarch--the fast walk at which they had descended the hill had quickenedito a dog trot and then to a run--pulled up a little uncertainly. Theyihad reached the border of the wooded tract which extended to the lakeishore, and in which their camp was situated, and now they knew that theidreaded danger of a forest fire was facing them. Just where it mightihave started, or how much headway it might have gained, was still to beidetermined, however; for, though there was smoke a-plenty, no line ofileaping flames showed.iiSam ran his eye along the front of the woods. Nowhere was the smokeirolling forth in volumes. It was like the coming of a fog, not yetithick but dimming everything. The breeze was light; so light, indeed,ithat though he made the test of a wetted finger, he could be sure ofilittle except that the general direction of the air currents was towardithe spot where he was rather than toward the lake. So far as it went,ithis was a hopeful condition. It meant that the spread of the fireiwould be away from the shore and the tent.iiHe strained his ears as well as his eyes, hoping to hear the shouts ofimen fighting the fire, but silence lay upon the woods. Plainly, theialarm had not spread to the summer settlement. The smoke was lying lowiand drifting away from the lake, and, presumably, had not yet beeniobserved by the men at work about the pavilion.iiSam gave his orders briskly, if a bit breathlessly:iiA>ZSpread out--in a line! DonA>Wt get too far apart, though. First fellowithat sees anything, yell and yell loud! Now, start in, fellows!A>[iiThey obeyed, readily enough, in very open order, as he had directed,iand went crashing through the undergrowth.iiSam himself was near the middle of the line. The end man to the leftiwas Tom Orkney, while Herman Boyd had the corresponding place to theiright. Sam went straight forward, but the flankers edged out as theyiadvanced, so that they steadily increased the amount of ground covered.iiAs every one in the party knew, the tract was of the sort to favor aiquick spread of a fire. There was a great deal of dry stuff, and theilong period of fine weather had made much of it as inflammable asitinder. Besides, the undergrowth was so dense and tangled in placesithat flames would find abundant opportunity to move along, while theidifficulties of coping with them would be increased. Such were theiconditions that Sam began to wonder that the whole tract was not in aiblaze. The fire must have been going for two or three hours, at least;ithat it had not made more progress was to be accounted for only by theilack of wind. In the woods, indeed, there was no perceptible breeze,iand the air was still and heavy as well as smoke-laden.iiLike his mates, Sam plowed ahead, making as much speed as he could. Theismoke grew denser, but not very markedly. He was beginning to believeithat his own course was not carrying him toward the fire, when a shout,iraised by Orkney, was repeated along the line.iiTom had made the looked-for discovery. Dipping into a hollow, whichitwo months before had been a swamp, he had been met first by a heavyipuff of gray fog, so to speak, and through it had caught the yellowiglint of flames. At his call the other boys hurried to him. No word oficommand from Sam or from anybody else was needed to set them at theiwork which was to be done. Breaking branches from trees, they began toibeat the burning brush in the rough and ready fashion which sometimesiis extremely effective in dealing with a fire of the sort. It was notilight work, nor was it pleasant. It seemed as if the smoke increasedieven as the flames were checked; and now and again one or anotheriof the club had to drop back for a moment, coughing and choking andigasping for air. A fine, dust-like ash, too, was raised in tiny clouds;imore disagreeable than the smoke itself and quite as penetrating ofithroat and lung; while the heat of the fire was sufficient to blisterihands incautiously venturing too near it. Yet, as woods fires go, thisidid not seem a hard one to deal with. The lack of breeze was in theiboysA>W favor. They were helped, also, by the A>Zlay of the land.A>[iiAs has been said, Orkney had come upon the fire in a swampy hollow.iProtracted as the drought had been, it had not sufficed to remove allithe moisture by the slow process of evaporation, so that there stilliremained miry patches, which served as natural brakes on the advanceiof the flames. A gale, of course, or even a brisk wind, would haveidisposed of such handicaps quickly enough, but in a comparative calmithey made a great difference. To Sam it became evident very quicklyithat the boys were not only checking the slow drift of the fire, butialso were beginning to get it under control. He paused for a momentito watch his companions. Orkney was pounding away lustily. The Sharkiwas exerting less effort, but his arms rose and fell with mathematicaliregularity. The others were performing, each in his own way, Step withitremendous swings of his long arms, Poke with a swift succession ofiqueer little pats, the Trojan and Herman Boyd busily and steadily. Muchiencouraged, Sam raised a cheery cry and fell to wielding his broom-likeiweapon with fresh vigor.iiIt isnA>Wt to be supposed, though, that with all the favorableiconditions, the club quickly finished the business in which it was nowiengaged. The spread of the fire might be checked, but it still burnedistubbornly in the area over which it had extended. There were heaps ofirubbish, dead twigs and branches and rotting leaves, which smoulderedisullenly long after the flames had died down; there were patches ofiglowing coals, potential danger spots, should a breeze spring up. Theiboys worked back and forth, invading the burned-over tract, crossingiand recrossing it until they were satisfied that immediate danger wasiover. Then came a sort of patrol for half an hour or more, with searchifor points threatening a fresh start for the flames. At last, Sam spokeithe word for which the others had waited.iiA>ZOut! Guess we can knock off now.A>[iiA>ZGood--and a good job at that!A>[ Poke declared.iiA>ZWell, IA>Wm ready to call it half a day and quit,A>[ said Herman. A>ZIA>WlliA>Wfess up--IA>Wm tired.A>[iiA>ZYes; itA>Ws hard work,A>[ Sam observed.iiStep thrust a finger almost into PokeA>Ws face, and began to laugh.iiA>ZHo, ho! Say, fellows, look at the boy beauty turned boy coal-heaver!A>[iiPoke ran a grimy hand across a grimy cheek. A>ZHuh! YouA>Wre no SpotlessiTown exhibit yourself,A>[ he retorted. A>ZYou look as if your home addressiwas A>VCare of any ash-barrel.A>WA>[iiA>ZWhatA>Ws the odds, so long as weA>Wve put out the fire?A>[ quoth Tom Orkney.iA>ZBut, I say! Anybody thought of the time? SunA>Ws down, but not one of usinoticed it!A>[iiThe boys glanced about them as curiously as if Tom had made someiremarkable discovery. They had paid no attention to watches orisunshine, and now dusk was coming on. Poke tightened his belt with aijerk.iiA>ZSupper time--and past,A>[ he remarked. A>ZGee, now that IA>Wm reminded ofieating, I could get away with about three square meals at once.A>[iiBy common consent the club started in the direction in which the campilay. They skirted the burned patch, but at the farther border Samihalted. The others pulled up too.iiA>ZWhatA>Ws on your mind, Sam?A>[ asked Step.iiSam wrinkled his brow. A>ZThere are a few things I donA>Wt quite figureiout. I suppose the fire started on this side; for this is the windwardiside, if you can say there was breeze enough to make a windward and aileeward. Now, what was there here to set it going?A>[iiA>ZI donA>Wt see anything,A>[ said Step, after a pause devoted to observation.iiA>ZNor I,A>[ chimed in two or three others.iiA>ZProbably somebody, going through, was smoking, and got careless with aimatch or cigarette stub,A>[ suggested Tom.iiA>ZMaybe,A>[ said Sam, shortly.iiA>ZWell, what likelier explanation have you?A>[iiSam contented himself with shaking his head and saying, A>ZItA>Ws queer,iall the same.A>[iiThe fire, in spite of its leisurely progress, had extended over perhapsitwo acres, nearly all of which would class as swamp land, though inimany places it was now as dry as any hill. Still, even where the mireihad hardened there were hummocks which made walking difficult, to sayinothing of the thick undergrowth on which the flames had fed. Anybody,istrolling through the woods, would be more likely to make a detouriabout the hollow than to tramp across it.iiA>ZOh, in a case like this you canA>Wt find out half the time what causedithe trouble,A>[ growled Poke. A>ZCome on! LetA>Ws get to the feed.A>[iiA>ZHope it isnA>Wt far to camp,A>[ said the Trojan.iiA>ZHuh! No need to hope!A>[ snapped the Shark.iiA>ZMeaning weA>Wve lost our way?A>[iiA>ZMeaning campA>Ws just ahead of us. Where are your eyes, anyway?A>[iiA>ZCheer up, Shark! DonA>Wt be a grouch,A>[ counseled Poke.iiThe Shark gave a characteristic shrug. A>ZIt ought to grouch anybody toisee how you fellows donA>Wt figure out things. Not that you ever will,ithough! But if only youA>Wd kept your wits working, youA>Wd know the tenticanA>Wt be an eighth of a mile from here.A>[iiA>ZConfound it! canA>Wt you be exact?A>[ Poke teased, with a wink at theiothers. A>ZTalking about things that grouch, whatA>Ws worse than a fellowiwho deals in eighths of a mile, when he ought to say twelve hundred andithirty-four ten-thousandths, plus? You vex me, Shark.A>[iiA>ZYou--you----A>[ snorted the Shark; then words failed him, and he set offiat a round pace.iiThe others followed, weariedly but willingly. Camp and supper wereipleasing thoughts; and the event proved that about the former, atileast, the Shark was right. In a moment or two the canvas of the tentishowed like a pale blur on the dark background. The rest quickeneditheir steps; but Sam, pausing, looked back.iiAfter all, the fire had started uncomfortably close to the camp. Itiwas borne in upon him that it was a singularly fortunate circumstanceifor the club that what little breeze there had been had blown in theiopposite direction. If some mischief maker had been at work----iiSamA>Ws expression was grave, as he turned and resumed his way. With allihis desire to be fair in his judgments, an ugly suspicion was obtrudingiitself upon him.iiiiiCHAPTER XIX A DREAM AND AN AWAKENINGiiiTired as he was, Sam was sleeping badly. He was dreaming, and theidream was peculiarly annoying; for it was very like a repetition ofithe dayA>Ws events, enacted over and over again. He was tramping throughiwoods which seemed to have no end; then he was fighting brush fires,iwhich broke out anew as fast as he could extinguish them; then heiwas coming back to the camp, and supper was to be made ready, and aisquabble between Poke and Step over possession of the coffee-pot was toibe settled half a dozen times; then when his weary mates had stretchedithemselves out and were already dozing, something impelled him to leaveithe tent and revisit the scene of the fire. Sam, tossing and turning,ihad visions of that trip repeated a score of times. Back and forthihe seemed to be trudging. There was moonlight. In it the tent had aighostlike effect, while the burned-over tract was a weird scene ofidesolation. There was nothing to indicate danger of the fire reviving,iand this was comforting; but the dream, presently, began to includeistrange and ominous sounds like the beat of great wings, suggestingidragons and other marvelous creations of unchecked fancy. In his wakingihours he was not an imaginative chap, but, once his eyes were closed,ihe could see as wonderful sights as even Poke, who rather specializediin nightmares, could conjure up. Yes, and he could hear sounds quite asistrange as Poke ever attempted to describe to a skeptical audience. Heiwas hearing them now; the beat of the wings was almost directly overihis head.iiSam sat up with a start. He dug his knuckles into his eyes. He peerediabout him. There was a wavering patch of faint light--that would be theiplay of moonbeams before the tent, he told himself. There were shadowyiforms about him, where the other members of the club lay asleep. Twoior three of them were breathing heavily; snoring, in fact, like goodifellows; but he realized that other sounds had awakened him. Then cameiexplanation. The flaps of the tent had been insecurely fastened, andiwere fluttering in a strong, if fitful, breeze.iiSam crawled out from his blankets. He picked his cautious way to theidoor of the tent, stumbling over somebodyA>Ws shoes, but recoveringibalance and escaping a fall. He looked out. There were scurrying cloudsioverhead, fleecy clouds which did not completely hide the moon; theibranches of the trees were swaying in a sharp gust. Half sheltered asihe was by the canvas, he felt the force of the wind.iiA>ZLucky it wasnA>Wt blowing this way in the afternoon,A>[ he reflected. A>ZItiwould have been a bad job, if----A>[iiHe didnA>Wt finish the sentence. He had not shaken off the influenceiof the dream, and there was, besides, the ugly doubt concerning theiaccidental cause of the fire. A moment he stood there, trying to setihis wits in order, as he himself would have phrased it. Then, of aisudden, he was as thoroughly awake and alert as fresh alarm could makeihim.iiA thin, grayish vapor was filling the space before the tent. Hisinostrils caught the pungent odor of wood smoke.iiSam wasted no time, once he had warning of the reappearance of theiperil. He sprang back into the tent to rouse his mates; but, even as heidid so, he was making swift calculation of the hour. The position ofithe moon gave him his best hint. Midnight had passed; of that he wasiquite sure.iiA>ZUp, everybody!A>[ he shouted. A>ZTurn out! Fire, fire, fire! Hustle! Get aimove on! The fireA>Ws started again, and this time itA>Wll travel this way!iUp with you, everybody!A>[iiThere was varied response to the summons. Herman Boyd, a light sleeper,iseemed to reach awakening and understanding together; for he was outiof bed and on his feet in a second. Tom Orkney sat up and yawnedicavernously. The SharkA>Ws voice rose sharply:iiA>ZConfound it all! WhatA>Ws the row about?A>[iiA>ZRow enough!A>[ cried Sam. A>ZWoods afire again!A>[iiA>ZUmph!A>[ growled the Shark; but he reached for his spectacles and havingiput them on, began to wriggle into his trousers most expeditiously.iiThe Trojan and Step tried to rise at once, and collided. Both wentidown, Step falling across the still recumbent Poke, who groanediabysmally, and struck out wildly in the dark. Whereat Step, iniself-protection, grappled with his plump friend, and the pair rolledifrom bunk to ground, adding immensely to the confusion in the narrowispace.iiFor two or three minutes pandemonium reigned. Then Sam, using voice andiarm vigorously, succeeded in restoring order, of a sort.iiA>ZHurry, hurry!A>[ he urged; and the exhortation was not wasted. The boysiscrambled into their clothes; they dragged on shoes, without much heedito ownership of the articles. Poke and Step, freed from each otherA>Wsiembrace, made as good time as the rest.iiLed by Sam, the club swarmed out of the tent. Once in the open, thereiwas no need for him to declare the danger. Clouds of smoke were drivingiby them, and beyond the smoke the yellow flicker of flames was visible.iiSam caught up the spade they had used in digging a ditch about theitent. Step noted the action, and gave a shout.iiA>ZHurrah! I know where thereA>Ws another--over by the old shed. ItA>Wsibroken, but itA>Wll help.A>[iiA>ZGet it!A>[ cried Sam; and away went Step on the run, bounding alongiwith a queer, kangaroo-like gait, which covered ground amazingly.iiTom Orkney and Herman armed themselves with axes. The Shark took aihatchet; the others laid hold upon clubs which might be of use inibeating the burning brush. Then they sallied forth for battle.iiThey had not far to go. Apparently the new fire was close to the tractiburned over in the afternoon; but, except in the matter of locality,ithe situation was entirely changed. The first fire had started whenialmost a dead calm prevailed; its spread had been slow. Now a strongibreeze was blowing, and the line of flame was advancing swiftly. It wasisweeping toward the camp, and had gained such headway that Sam, at aiglance, realized that the club had its work cut out for it, if it wasito save the tent and its contents.iiAs has been told, the woods near the lake offered plenty of fuel. Samiand his fellows, charging up to the fire, quickly discovered thatithe beating-out process, which had served well enough in the earlieriinstance, was no longer effective. Here and there, to be sure, it wasipossible to check the enemy on a narrow front; but, beyond this, theileaping, yellow tongues continued to gain on either flank.iiA spectator, free of anxiety for results, could have found the sceneisufficiently picturesque. The wavering illumination played strangeitricks with lights and shadows. The moving line of flames suggestedia march of torch-bearers, straggling and out of step but alwaysiadvancing, even if irregularly. Here a tree-trunk stood out in theifull glare; there dense, overhanging boughs were like the roof of aicavern. For a dozen yards, perhaps, the fire seemed to frolic in theiundergrowth; beyond was a stretch where it raged savagely. The windisent the smoke swirling through the trees, sometimes in great, rollingivolumes, sometimes whipped to streaming ribbons. Blazing twigs and bitsiof bark sailed away merrily to fall in the thickets and become freshicenters of destruction.iiThe boys had scant time for such observations, but they did not need toimake them to grasp the extent of the danger. Their first attack, as hasibeen related, succeeded in halting the fire for a space of half a dozenirods; but on both sides the yellow tongues advanced, and, indeed,ithreatened to creep in behind them. Sam marked this peril. He calledito Step, who had come up, bringing the broken spade from the old shed;iand with him fell back to a comparatively open space well behind theipresent fighting line--and uncomfortably close to the camp, for thatimatter.iiSamA>Ws plan was simple, but held promise. It was a rough and readyiadaptation of the method often used by farmers in fighting grass andibrush fires by plowing furrows across the track of the approachingiflames, the freshly turned ground, of course, offering no fuel forithem. The boys had no plow, but with the spades, plied desperately, itiwas possible to dig a shallow trench, which served a double purpose,iin that it not only broke the continuity of the carpet of rubbish,ibut gave chance to widen the safety band by throwing dirt from theiexcavation over the dead leaves and branches beside it. By greatigood fortune there was a sort of pathway along which Sam and Stepicould work, and here they made the dirt fly, while the others diditheir best to hold back the fire on their immediate front. In thisithey succeeded, to the extent, at least, of enabling Sam and Stepito complete their A>Zsafety zoneA>[ for a distance which meant a realilessening of the danger to the camp.iiPoke, too, had an inspiration. Its source may have been in a quantityiof smoke which he had inhaled, and which forced him to fall back,igasping for breath. At all events, as he stood, coughing and rubbingihis eyes, a flaming brand fell close beside him. In an instant a newilittle fire was started. Poke was about to stamp it out, when he tookisecond thought, and permitted it to burn for a moment, not interferingiuntil a patch four or five feet long and half as wide was ablaze. Theniin vigorous fashion he plied his club. The result was a patch whereifire would not travel again because fire had already ravaged the littleispace.iiIt was another instance of hitting upon an old device--that of settingiA>Zback firesA>[; but Poke was vastly pleased by his discovery. He shoutedito his friends, who, to tell the truth, were quite ready to try any newimove. To put it in military phrase, they had been fighting a rear-guardiaction, which had its discouraging aspects because of steady, if slow,iretirement; and they rallied with a will to PokeA>Ws assistance. Theisafety zone widened and lengthened; the A>Zback firedA>[ strips borderingithe trench extended almost as far as it did. So much accomplished, theiboys paused for a little in their labors. They stationed themselvesibehind the defenses, whose strength was about to be put to the test.iiThe fire swept up to the barrier. It seemed to beat upon it as surfibeats upon a beach. There was no need of a lively fancy to pictureia succession of waves; for with the fluctuations of the wind theiflames rose and fell like so many combers; while the hint of spray wasicarried out by tiny showers of glowing embers, which sailed over theiobstruction. To these the boys gave prompt attention, with all theigreater zeal because they saw that they were holding back the mainifire. Five minutes showed their success in this respect. So far asithe ditch ran, the great danger was over; they were able to cope withiflying sparks falling behind their line. It remained for the Shark toigive timely warning of the limits of their success and of the menaceistill existing on either hand.iiA>ZLook! There!A>[ He was tugging at SamA>Ws arm with one hand and pointingiwith the other. A>ZItA>Ws getting A>Wround us! Whew!A>[iiThe Shark was pointing to the left, but what Sam saw there made himiglance swiftly to the right as well. In both directions was abundanticause for alarm.iiWhat had happened, and was happening, required little explanation. Theiboys had devoted themselves to blocking the path leading straight toithe camp, and had been forced to neglect the flanks of their defenses.iThere the fire had an unobstructed way. Already it had lapped the endsiof the ditch, and was moving on, edging in upon the sheltered areaibehind the barrier. In other words, the camp now was threatened fromiboth sides, if not from in front. Older heads might have foreseenithe situation, but it is probable that the club, with its availableiforce, had done as much as it could have accomplished with the mostiexperienced leadership. The simple fact was that the fire was too bigito be fought and beaten by half a dozen boys or men.iiSam kept his head. He made a hurried calculation.iiA>ZFellows, weA>Wve got to have help. This thing is getting A>Wway beyond us.iAnd itA>Ws getting beyond a case of saving the camp. ItA>Ws going to be aiquestion of stopping the fire before it works around the end of theilake and reaches the pavilion and the cottages.A>[iiThe Trojan voiced the complaint that was in the minds of all of theiclub: A>ZConfound the folks over there! Why havenA>Wt they turned out andigiven us a lift? Fire fightingA>Ws everybodyA>Ws business.A>[iiA>ZIf everybody knows about the fire,A>[ Sam amended.iiA>ZGeeminy! How can those people help knowing? The smoke is blowing rightiin their direction. Then thereA>Ws the glare. They canA>Wt all be dead overithere!A>[iiA>ZBut they can be asleep.A>[iiA>ZThatA>Ws right,A>[ Poke broke in. A>ZRemember, we were right on the spot,ias you might say, and mighty little we worried till Sam happened to beibothered by an uneasy conscience or something. And so----A>[iiSam cut short PokeA>Ws philosophical observations.iiA>ZNever mind that, now! Step, youA>Wd better hustle over to the otheriside of the lake and wake A>Wem up. Poke, go along with him, and rout outiany neighbors you can find. The rest of us will stay here and hold backithe fire as well as we can till help comes. Orkney, take Herman andithe Trojan and work along to the left. The Shark and I will go to theiright. And Step and Poke, hurry--both of you!A>[iiStep needed no urging. Away he went, on the run, with Poke close at hisiheels.iiiiiCHAPTER XX THE BIG FIREiiiSamA>Ws generalship had the virtue, at least, of not attemptingiimpossibilities.iiIt had been shown that by concentrating effort the boys could check theifire for a comparatively few yards; but it was just as clear that suchia break in the line of its advance would figure little in the generaliresult. In short, so far as the club was concerned, the fire was out oficontrol. It was spreading rapidly. How far it already had extended Samidid not know. To gain information on this point was one of the reasonsifor the division of his forces. He had no expectation that OrkneyA>Wsisquad could accomplish more than he set as a task for the Shark andihimself; and this was to do a sort of picket duty, keeping watch on theiflames, hindering their progress, if possible, and preparing to reporticonditions accurately, when reinforcements should arrive.iiIt quickly became evident that the fire was covering a wide area.iSam and the Shark could catch the gleam of flames far to the right.iSeemingly, though, the progress of the conflagration was mostiirregular. The ground was broken, with many little ravines and smalliswampy patches; the growth varied in density; the wind apparently hadihad much greater effect in some places than in others. The two boysimoved along at a fairly rapid pace, for the most part; though theyihalted now and then to extinguish some blaze in bush or grass tuft,iwhere a flying brand had fallen. The smoke was annoying rather thanioverpowering; for while it was rising in great clouds, these wereicaught by the strong breeze and swept away. By keeping a little backifrom the fire line the boys found that they avoided the worst of thisitrouble, most of the smoke passing overhead. Of course, they could notiescape it wholly. Again and again the acrid gray fog closed about them,iand left them coughing and gasping for a moment, while the air wasiagain clearing.iiBeing bent on observation, Sam pressed on. He made mental note of whatihe saw, and was little encouraged thereby. It was a big fire, and itiwas going to be bigger still. The chances were excellent that the wholeidistrict about the end of the lake would be burned over.iiOf a sudden, the Shark plucked at his sleeve.iiA>ZLook! A>WMost down to the shore we are.A>[iiSam obeyed the order, and saw that the Shark was right. A tiny bay cutideeply into the land, bringing the water within a hundred feet of whereithey stood.iiA>ZThatA>Ws all right--gives us a way out,A>[ said Sam. A>ZIf worse comes toiworst, we can take to the lake.A>[iiA>ZUmph! Swimming job--waterA>Ws deep all along this shore.A>[iiA>ZWell, we can swim, then.A>[iiThe Shark nodded. A>ZI guess thatA>Ws so, only----A>[ Then he broke off;istared hard at a clump of brush beyond the cove; whistled shrilly.iiA>ZWhatA>Ws up?A>[ Sam demanded curiously.iiA>ZSomethingA>Ws moving over there.A>[iiA>ZWhat do you mean?A>[iiA>ZJust what I say. Something--or somebody--is stirring in that thicket.A>[iiSam peered in the direction indicated.iiA>ZI donA>Wt see anything,A>[ he objected.iiA>ZI donA>Wt--now. I did see something, though.A>[iiTry as hard as he could, Sam made out nothing except the shadowyioutlines of the thicket. The light, to be sure, was both faint anditrickily deceptive; one might easily be misled by a flutter of branchesiin a sharp gust.iiA>ZWhat did it look like?A>[ he asked.iiThe Shark hesitated. A>ZWell--well, it seemed to me somebody wasiwriggling through the brush.A>[iiA>ZWe can settle it quick enough,A>[ Sam declared. He strode to the clump,iand as he approached it had a suspicion that he glimpsed a flittingiform vanishing in the darkness a score of yards away. But it was only aisuspicion; certainly nobody was hiding in the cover he searched.iiA>ZWell, what do you think now?A>[ he inquired.iiBut the Shark had a new point of interest. He had ranged down to theiwaterA>Ws edge, and was staring at an object floating some distance fromishore.iiA>ZBoat--sure as youA>Wre alive!A>[ he declared.iiA>ZSo it is--boat gone adrift!A>[ Sam agreed, after a momentA>Ws study of theiobject.iiThe Shark meditated an instant. A>ZLook here, Sam!A>[ he said. A>ZTake theiway the windA>Ws blowing--make note where that boat is--gives you oneithing sure: Boat must have been beached just about here.A>[iiA>ZYou mean to have drifted as that boatA>Ws drifted?A>[iiA>ZJust what I mean. Know what my notion is? Well, itA>Ws that somebodyilanded in this cove, left his boat, and went into the woods. When heicame back a few minutes ago he found that the boat had worked off, andihad been carried out into the lake by the wind. Then he saw or heardiyou and me coming, and bolted through the bushes. That shows that heididnA>Wt want to be seen.A>[iiSam nodded. A>ZThat sounds reasonable. Only why should anybody be afraidiof us?A>[iiA>ZNobody would be--if he wasnA>Wt up to something queer. When things areiall right, and square, and aboveboard, everybody tries to pull withieverybody else in fighting a forest fire. That fellow--whoever heiwas--ought to have joined us. Instead, he got away as fast as he coulditravel.A>[iiAgain Sam inclined his head in agreement. A>ZShark, youA>Wre figuring thisithing out right! I had my doubts if you really saw anybody; but theiboat makes it a different case. And IA>Wm going to find out who thatiskulker is. Come on!A>[iiWith that Sam plunged into the woods again, the Shark keeping with him.iThe mystery of the stranger for the moment took precedence over theitask of watching the fire.iiFor a little the boys kept close to the shore, believing that theiboatA>Ws owner naturally would try to work back to the cove, and thenceiswim out to the drifting craft. The Shark had a theory that was justiwhat the stranger had been about to do, when he was frightened off byitheir appearance; and Sam was disposed to accept it as a reasonableisupposition.iiFive minutesA>W scouting failed to reveal a trace of the fugitive. Itishowed, too, that the fire in this quarter had spread more slowly, andithat the farther the boys advanced, the more distant the flames wereifrom the shore. The pair halted and took counsel.iiA>ZThat chapA>Ws escaped--for the present, anyhow,A>[ said Sam. A>ZWeA>Wd betteribe turning firemen again.A>[iiA>ZUmph! IA>Wd rather land that runaway,A>[ objected the Shark. A>ZWhatA>Ws moreito the point, weA>Wve a better chance to do it than to stop the fire.A>[iiSam reflected briefly. A>ZI guess you may be right,A>[ he admitted. A>ZAllithe same, we can try to kill two birds with one stone--watch the fireiand look for that fellow at the same time. And letA>Ws be at it!A>[iiAgain the two set out, this time putting the lake behind them andimoving inland. For a space the growth was heavier and the groundiA>ZcleanerA>[--that is, there was less litter of dead leaves and branches.iMoreover, a low ridge for the moment hid the fire, so that there wasinothing to delay their progress.iiPressing on at a brisk pace, they strained eyes and ears for evidenceiof the strangerA>Ws presence. Twice or thrice Sam thought he saw or heardisomething, but in each case it proved to be a false alarm. Once it wasia frightened rabbit crossing his path, and again the rustlings mightihave been made by some smaller woods creature. Presently, though,ithere was a sound which did not die away in a moment, as the otherisounds had died, but steadily increased in volume; a peculiar soundithat was like a low roar. Its explanation was not far to seek. Theiridge bent sharply to the left. The boys rounded the curve, and haltediaghast at the sight they beheld.iiFor a little the higher ground had concealed the spread of the flames,ibut now, of a sudden, the pair could view the full fury of the fire.iHere it was burning on a scale far greater than any that had marked itsiprogress in other parts of the woods. The crackling of burning brushiwas quite lost in the roaring of the sheets of flame. The boys seemedito be looking into a huge furnace, in which trees and logs were swiftlyibeing consumed. The forward line of the fire was like a moving wall,ibeing pushed forward by some mighty, if irregular, force. And, as theyigazed, Sam and the Shark saw great brands caught up by a sharp gust ofithe rising gale and carried along in gleaming arcs to fall in the dryitimber beyond. They saw vines burned from trees to which they had clungiand fall, writhing like serpents in their descent; they saw a resinousipine burst into flame from root to top, as if it were some pyrotechniciset-piece. A shower of sparks fell close to them; there came another,iand it was like a fiery rain upon their devoted heads.iiThe boys gave ground. Compared with this conflagration, the fire in itsiearlier stages had been as childA>Ws play. It was no longer a question ofichecking or even hindering its progress. They fell back, reluctantlyibut helplessly.iiA>ZIf--if itA>Ws as big--at the other end, they--they wonA>Wt be able to stopiit this side of the pavilion,A>[ Sam said brokenly.iiThe Shark was the most undemonstrative of mortals, but now he wasiwringing his hands in a queer sort of despair.iiA>ZConfound it! It--it isnA>Wt fair--a fire like that--it wonA>Wt give aifellow half a chance!A>[ he moaned.iiA>ZA hundred men would be needed to fight it here.A>[iiA>ZThey canA>Wt raise half so many to save the settlement.A>[iiA>ZBut the other neighbors----A>[iiA>ZNot enough of A>Wem to do any good. TheyA>Wll have to telephone to townifor help.A>[iiSam considered the case for a moment. A>ZThe folks at the pavilion willithink of that, of course.... And Step and Poke must have roused A>Wem byithis time. ThereA>Ws nothing we can do about it.A>[iiA>ZNot a thing!A>[ said the Shark. A>ZAnd our campA>Ws as good as done for, Iireckon. Our little stop was all right in its way, but thisA>[--he brokeioff and waved a hand at the great fire--A>Zthis is big business, Sam.iItA>Wll burn over everything on this side of the lake.A>[iiA>ZIA>Wm afraid so,A>[ said Sam gloomily. A>ZMaybe thereA>Wll be time, though, toiwork back and save some of our plunder.A>[iiA>ZDoubt it,A>[ quoth the Shark crisply. A>ZNo harm trying, though,A>[ he added.iiSam gave a parting glance at the furnace, and found it raging moreifuriously than ever. It was a wonderful sight, fascinating ifiterrifying. His fancy stirred; there were before him glowing arches andilong aisles reaching far back into the woods through which the flamesihad spread; but in the foreground, where the fire was roaring towardihim, it was easy to picture a monster of savage destruction.iiA>ZI--I--it makes me think of a--a phrase I never really understoodibefore----A>[ he began.iiA>ZSure! Same here!A>[ exclaimed the Shark. A>ZItA>Ws--er--er--itA>Ws A>VA singedicatA>W--or A>VA burnt childA>W--one or the other--A>Vdreads the fire.A>WA>[iiSamA>Ws laugh was a little tremulous. A>ZHo, ho! A>VDevouring elementA>W--thatiwas what I was thinking about. But youA>Wre on the right track, too,iShark. WeA>Wre in a fair way to be singed and maybe burned, if we try toistay here longer.A>[ii[Illustration: THE BOYS FELT AS IF THEY STOOD BEFORE AN ENORMOUSiFURNACE]iiIt was no more than the truth. So great was the heat that the boys,ieven though they were at a considerable distance from the leapingiflames, felt as if they stood before the discharge pipes of an enormousifurnace. Sam retreated a pace. So did his companion. Then, together,ithey turned and started back toward the lake.iiIt was their intention to keep close to the shore and make their way toithe camp--if that had still escaped destruction--in the hope of savingithe effects they had left in the tent, and then to rejoin the others ofithe club. They made haste, running when the ground permitted; andicame in sight of the water, with no more serious incident than a tumbleifor the Shark, whose foot caught on a root. On the lake shore, though,ithey had a reminder of their still unsuccessful quest of the mysteriousistranger.iiThere was a clearly audible crashing of brush very near them. Bothiboys stopped in their tracks. For an instant they peered into the dimithickets, whence the sounds proceeded. Then, by a common impulse, theyisprang forward. The great fire was forgotten, and their one thought wasito overtake the person who seemed to be in such fear of detection.iiiiiCHAPTER XXI ROUSING THE NEIGHBORHOODiiiStepA>Ws long legs carried him over the ground at a great rate, but Pokeidid not fall far behind, when the chums started to rouse the peopleiof the settlement near the pavilion. They hurried through the woods,ireached the road which wound round the end of the lake, and cameipresently to a farmhouse, which, naturally enough at that hour, was asidark as the trees before it.iiStep unhesitatingly turned in at the gate, and steered for the frontidoor. As his hand touched the old-fashioned brass knocker, however, heiheard a savage growl and then a warning cry from Poke, as a big dogicame bounding from the shadows near the barn.iiStep gave one lusty stroke with the knocker, then sprang aside to avoidithe dogA>Ws charge. He took a vigorous kick at the animal, which swervediin time to avoid harm, but also missed its mark; for though it snappediviciously at the boyA>Ws leg, the big teeth failed to meet in his flesh.iStep retreated from the porch, and Poke, picking up a stone--luckily heihad halted in the roadway--threw it with so sure an aim that the dogiyelped with pain, and marking that these were adversaries not to beiattacked recklessly, began to bound about Step, barking furiously.iiSo far as awakening the occupants of the house was concerned, theiperformance was a great success. Up went a window; a head protruded; aivoice spoke wrathfully:iiA>ZClear out, you vagabones! What you mean by skulkinA>W around at thisitime oA>W night? Get along with you, or IA>Wll set the dog on you!A>[iiA>ZHuh! You donA>Wt need to set him on us--heA>Ws a self-starter, all right!A>[iretorted Poke; but Step achieved practical results.iiA>ZFire! Fire! Fire!A>[ he shouted at the top of his lungs.iiThe head protruded farther from the window.iiA>ZFire? Whereabouts?A>[iiA>ZIn the woods--beyond the lake! We saw it, and tried to stop it, butiitA>Ws too big for us.A>[iiDown went the window with a bang. There was a momentA>Ws delay. The dog,iapparently regarding the affair as taken over by higher authority,iwas content to snarl and circle Step at a respectful distance. Thenithe door opened, and a man came out, pulling on a coat as he came. Heistrode to higher ground beyond the house, turned toward the lake, andiuttered a startled exclamation.iiThe messengers had followed him to the knoll. There they had a firstiview of the extent of the fire. The glare seemed to light the whole skyito the west. Here and there the flames were in full sight, while aboveithem were rolling masses of smoke.iiA>ZGee-whittaker! SpreadinA>W like bad news and travelinA>W like Sam Hill!iAnd with this wind blowinA>W----A>[ The man broke off in mid-sentence;iwhistled sharply; turned to the boys. A>ZYou two hustle along to theicottages. Rout out everybody. And say! Tell A>Wem from me theyA>Wd betteriget word to town. TheyA>Wve got telephones, and nowA>Ws the time to useiA>Wem.A>[iiWith that the farmer started off, taking the road by which Step andiPoke had come; while they, in small need of the counsel he had given,iran toward the pavilion.iiThe cottage settlement was grouped about the public building.iAltogether there were a score of houses, most of them now occupied forithe season; so that there promised to be men enough available to make aiconsiderable force of fire fighters. Taking a lesson from their recentiexperience, the boys raised the cry of A>ZFire! Fire! Fire!A>[ when theyineared the first of the cottages.iiThe response was prompt. For one thing, there was small need ofiexplanation of the alarm; for from the neighborhood of the pavilionithere was an unobstructed view of the opposite shore of the lake andithe extent of the fireA>Ws spread. Already the flames were making aiwonderful spectacular display, which served as most effective warningito the cottagers of the need of haste in forming their fire brigade.iIt was almost like a warshipA>Ws crew obeying the call to quarters, soihurriedly did every able-bodied man turn out for service. There wasisome confusion, of course. Poke and Step found themselves in the middleiof a little crowd. Two or three were putting questions at once--andinot waiting for replies. Plainly, the cause of the fire or the preciseipoint of its beginning was of minor interest and importance, comparediwith the present danger. There was aimless scurrying to and fro. In oneiof the houses a woman began to shriek hysterically. Then rose a sternivoice of authority. The boys knew the voice. It was that of Mr. Zorn.iiA>ZGet axes and spades! Hogan, youA>Wve got a plow--load it in your lightiwagon and hitch up on the jump! Mack, you do the same thing! And,iEd!A>[--his voice rose sharply. A>ZEd, I say! Hang it! where is that boy?A>[iiThere was no reply. Apparently the younger Zorn was not present, noriwas his whereabouts known.iiAgain Mr. Zorn called, loudly and impatiently: A>ZEd! Ed! I want you!A>[iiThere was a brief silence. Then somebody had a suggestion to make:iiA>ZReckon heA>Ws started for the fire--boy fashion--got to see whatA>Wsidoing, you know.A>[iiA>ZMaybe heA>Ws taken a boat and is crossing the lake,A>[ somebody elseihazarded.iiA>ZIA>Wll go and see,A>[ a third volunteered, and ran down to the shore. Heiwas back in a moment or two.iiA>ZThereA>Ws a boat missing,A>[ he reported. A>ZLikelyA>Ws not EdA>Ws off to seeithe circus. And I donA>Wt know but he had the right idea. Looks to me asiif the heft of the fire was straight across from here.A>[iiA>ZBut the danger point for us is at the end of the lake,A>[ Mr. Zornideclared. A>ZThatA>Ws the way the fireA>Wll work around--it wonA>Wt jump acrossithe pond. Wish I knew where that boy was, but--well, itA>Ws our businessito get to business. Come on!A>[iiStep plucked at his sleeve. A>ZItA>Ws an awfully big fire, sir. We thoughtiat first we could stop it, but we saw we were mistaken.A>[iiMr. Zorn peered at him. A>ZYouA>Wre one of the crowd camping over there,iarenA>Wt you?A>[iiA>ZYes, sir--but we didnA>Wt start the fire.A>[iiA>ZUmph! WeA>Wll have to look into that part of it later on. Meant to lookiyou over, but kept putting it off. Now itA>Ws too late.A>[iiHe was moving away, but again Step stopped him. A>ZItA>Ws a big fire, aniawfully big fire. And itA>Ws getting bigger and bigger all the while.iMaybe youA>Wll need to get help from outside--all the help you can raise.A>[iiMr. Zorn studied the opposite shore and the fiery picture it presented.iThe trees close to the water made a dark fringe, through which heihad glimpses of the glare of flames, even where the fire itself hadinot burned its way into clear view. And, as a matter of fact, it wasinow showing in places which had been dark when the alarm roused theisettlement. He tried to gauge the rapidity of its spread; he made noteiof the stiff breeze; he knew the tinder-like condition of the woods.iiA>ZBoy, youA>Wre right,A>[ he said curtly. A>ZMan-size job this is going toibe--big enough for all the men we can raise.A>[ He turned to the group.iA>ZJim, youA>Wve got a telephone in your house. Call up the fire departmentiin town, and tell the chief we want all the men he can send us. HeA>Wlliknow what apparatus would be of any use. And Joe Briggs!A>[iiA>ZHere!A>[ said a voice.iiA>ZJoe, take my car! Go down the main road, and rout out the folks thatilive along it. If you can get a load of huskies, with axes and spades,iturn around and bring A>Wem back, and have somebody else carry the call.iBut until you get a load, keep on stirring A>Wem up yourself.A>[iiA>ZRight-o!A>[ replied Joe Briggs, and ran toward the little garage behindithe Zorn house.iiBetween summer residents and workmen employed on the new buildings, theivolunteer fire brigade mustered more than a score of men by the timeilate comers had joined the others. Altogether, it was a miscellaneouslyigarbed party, just as it was variously equipped for the task in hand.iThere were men completely, if hastily, dressed; there were men inistrictly emergency outfits. Some carried spades or hoes; others hadiaxes. Half a dozen bore lanterns, the light of which revealed the oddivariety in the companyA>Ws costumes and fire fighting weapons. It wasievident, however, that a number knew well the business before them, andiit was a very practically efficient little force which Mr. Zorn headed.iiNobody paid much attention to Step and Poke. They had given the alarmiand roused the settlement, and there, seemingly, their functioniended. No guide was needed to find the fire or show the way to reachiit. Off marched the brigade, leaving the chums to follow as theyipleased. Neither of them, though, was in haste to go. Poke, peeringiquestioningly at Step, discovered that the latter was regarding him inithe same fashion.iiA>ZWell?A>[ It was Step who spoke, a curious note in his voice.iiA>ZOh, IA>Wm wondering,A>[ said Poke.iiA>ZSame here. And same wonder, I reckon.A>[iiA>ZIf itA>Ws about Ed Zorn--yes.A>[iiA>ZItA>Ws about him, and about the boat. And I didnA>Wt notice Jack Hagle,ieither. But his folks are living out here, just as the Zorns are.A>[iiA>ZExactly! And those two fellows would be likely to be together inianything. And if they were out on the lake, they must have seen theiblaze long ago.A>[iiA>ZWhat reason would they have for being out at this hour?A>[iiA>ZMight be fishing for pout.A>[iiA>ZI donA>Wt believe it!A>[ Step declared.iiA>ZI didnA>Wt say I believe it,A>[ Poke pointed out. A>ZItA>Ws just aipossibility. But that isnA>Wt the interesting thing, which is: If eitheriof those fellows--or both of them--saw the fire, why didnA>Wt theyirow in at once and notify their people? Something queer there, Step;isomething queer!A>[iiA>ZYouA>Wve said it!A>[ cried Step, with conviction.iiObeying the same impulse, the two moved toward the shore. Across theilake the flames were making a brilliant display, and the field ofiillumination was extending far out over the surface. It was still aishifting and uncertain light, smoke-dimmed at times and varying as theiwind fanned the fire, but, presently, it enabled them to make out aifloating object well out from the land.iiA>ZHi! Look--straight out from us!A>[ Poke exclaimed.iiA>ZI see it,A>[ Step replied. A>ZBoat, isnA>Wt it?A>[ A>ZGuess it must be.A>[iiA>ZUmph! Then itA>Ws queerer still.A>[iiA>ZWhatA>Ws queerer?A>[iiA>ZThat whoeverA>Ws in it didnA>Wt give the alarm.A>[iiPoke stared his hardest. A>ZIA>Wm not sure--I canA>Wt make it out foricertain--but _is_ there anybody in that boat, anyway?A>[iiA>ZGive it up. CanA>Wt tell from here.A>[iiA>ZWell, IA>Wm going to find out,A>[ said Poke, and ran to the waterA>Ws edge.iiTwo or three fishing punts were drawn up on the sand. Poke laid handsion the nearest and with StepA>Ws aid pushed it out until it was afloat.iThen both boys climbed aboard, and picked up the short oars lying inithe bottom of the boat. Five minutesA>W work put them alongside theidrifting boat. Step caught its gunwale, and made as careful inspectioniof the craft as was possible in the faint light.iiA>ZUmph! Nobody home!A>[ he reported. A>ZOars laid across the thwarts.iEverything left in order; no water in the bottom. I donA>Wt believe itA>Wsia case of anybody tumbling overboard.A>[iiA>ZBy A>VanybodyA>W you mean Zorn?A>[ said Poke.iiA>ZOf course.A>[iiPoke took thought. A>ZLooks to me as if he landed somewhere, and didnA>Wtimake his boat secure. And the way the windA>Ws blowing--well, itA>Ws easyiguessing her line of drift. But, I say, Step! WhatA>Ws Zorn doing over oniour side at this time oA>W night?A>[iiA>ZLetA>Ws find out!A>[ cried Step. With the painter of the punt in hisigrasp he sprang into the other boat. A>ZCome along, Poke! ThisA>Wll beihandier to row, and weA>Wll tow old Snub-Nose.A>[iiPoke accepted the suggestion. A>ZWhereA>Wll we head for?A>[ he asked as heisettled himself on a thwart.iiThe question was answered, but not by Step. From the shore came a hail,iquickly repeated.iiThe boys strained their ears.iiA>ZSounds as if it came from near our camp,A>[ Step asserted.iiA>ZAnd it sounds like Tom OrkneyA>Ws voice,A>[ Poke added.iiStep made swift survey. A>ZTell you what! FireA>Ws turned the ends of ouriditch--tentA>Ws a goner!A>[iiPoke nodded agreement. He could see that while the fire had not burnedithrough the timber clear to the shore, it was now very close, iniplaces, to the waterA>Ws edge. And one of these places, by his reckoning,ihad been the site of the camp. He dipped his oar, and Step followedisuit. The towing line tautened. Even with the drag of the clumsy puntithe pair were able to make fair headway, so hard did they row and soideterminedly.iiThe voice that had hailed them began to give directions. A>ZPull withiyour left!... There--thatA>Ws enough.... Left again!... Hold herithere!... Now a bit on the right--as you are, as you are! Steady,isteady--no hurry!... Right again! You fellows have got too much powerion one side.... ThatA>Ws the ticket, and here you are! A>WVast rowing!A>[iiSomebody caught the bow of the boat. Step and Poke turned on theiriseats to behold Orkney, knee deep in the water, grinning at them.iThere was a decided increase in the glare from the big fire, and theyicould make out his face plainly. Back of him, on the sand, were theiTrojan and Herman Boyd, their arms full of blankets and other campingiparaphernalia.iiA>ZSaved what we could,A>[ Orkney tersely explained. A>ZTouch and go gettingiwhat we did, at that.... What are you doing with two boats, though?iNever mind! The ark in back will do for the freight. Chuck the stuffiinto her, fellows!A>[iiThe punt was drawn in and swiftly loaded. Then Orkney and his followersijoined Step and Poke in the lighter boat.iiA>ZYouA>Wve stirred up the cottagers, of course?A>[ said Tom.iiA>ZYou bet we have!A>[ Step declared. A>ZWe had A>Wem going, all right! AnditheyA>Wve sent on the alarm to town. Jiminy! but theyA>Wll need everybodyithey can call in from fifty miles around! But, I say! WhereA>Ws Sam?A>[iiA>ZHe took the Shark and went scouting yonder,A>[ Orkney answered.iiPoke stood up in the boat. He peered long and anxiously at the shore.iiA>ZI should think Sam would be working back,A>[ he remarked. A>ZFire looks asiif it was worse over that way. Those two fellows couldnA>Wt fight thatisort of a whirl any more than they could fight the wind.A>[iiA>ZRight you are,A>[ said Orkney soberly enough.iiThe boats had drifted away from the beach, and their passengers couldisurvey a wide stretch of burning woods. Nowhere had the fire quiteireached the waterA>Ws edge, but here and there it had drawn very near toiit. Moreover, such tremendous headway had been gained by the flamesithat it was clear that the growth along the bank was doomed. Whateverithe fire-fighters might accomplish would have to be done at the ends ofithe line.iiA>ZSam and the Shark ought to be coming back,A>[ Poke said nervously.iA>ZI--I--what in the world do you suppose is keeping them?A>[iiA>ZDonA>Wt know,A>[ Orkney said shortly. A>ZCourse, they can swim for it--ifithey have to. But what theyA>Wre up to----A>[iiStep didnA>Wt wait to hear the end of the sentence, but caught up his oar.iiA>ZLetA>Ws meet A>Wem half-way.A>[iiA>ZGood scheme!A>[ cried Poke, and dropped back on his thwart. A>ZYou steer,iOrkney,A>[ he added. A>ZThe others can keep the sharpest kind of a lookout.A>[iiWith the punt dragging behind, the boatA>Ws pace was very moderate.iSlow as it was, however, the voyagers cruised for perhaps half a mileiwithout gaining clew to the whereabouts of their missing friends. Byithis time they had passed the limits of the fire.iiOrkneyA>Ws face was very grave, indeed, as he guided the boat throughia half-circle, and the return trip was begun. The light wasistrengthening; for now some of the trees overhanging the water wereiablaze.iiA>ZKeep your eyes peeled for swimmers!A>[ he called to Herman and theiTrojan.iiThey nodded, but said nothing; and the boat moved slowly on. Stepiand Poke were willing but not finished oarsmen; they splashed waterirecklessly. The crackling flames were distinctly audible. For a littleithese were the only sounds on lake or land. Then, of a sudden, thereiwas a shout from both lookouts, which seemed to be echoed from theishore.iiOrkney swung the boatA>Ws head; the Trojan was pointing eagerly atifigures showing clearly on a sand spit, behind which brush was blazingilike a great torch.iiA>ZSam and the Shark, both of A>Wem!A>[ he exclaimed. Then his voice roseishrilly in excitement and amazement. A>ZYes, Sam and the Shark, butiJupiter Crickets! See whoA>Wre with A>Wem!A>[iiiiiCHAPTER XXII A GAME OF HARE AND HOUNDSiiiWhen Sam and the Shark plunged into the brush, it was with full beliefithat they were close upon the trail of the fugitive. Supposedly,itoo, each had heard the same sounds. It was a curious circumstance,itherefore, that they did not keep side by side, but almost from theistart drew apart, a fact which escaped SamA>Ws notice for a little. Soiintent was he on the pursuit that he failed to observe that the Sharkiwas no longer at his elbow; and discovery of this was delayed until heibecame aware that the sounds by which he had tried to guide his courseihad died away. Then, pulling up, he peered eagerly about him. Theigrowth was dense enough to shut off the glare of the fire, and he couldimake out nothing but lumpy shadows of thickets and black pillars ofitree trunks. Even the Shark had vanished in the gloom.iiSam whistled softly, then called. The answer came promptly.iiA>ZThis way, Sam! YouA>Wre off the track.A>[iiA>ZNot a bit of it,A>[ Sam retorted. A>ZBut where are you trying to go?A>[iiThere was an instantA>Ws pause. Then Sam heard twigs crack under foot,iand, presently, made out the Shark approaching.iiA>ZWhat are you waiting for?A>[ the younger boy demanded impatiently.iiA>ZYou--for one thing,A>[ said Sam. A>ZWhat did you stray off so for?A>[iiA>ZStray yourself! I chased a noise till it stopped. Then I stopped, too.A>[iiA>ZSame here! But itA>Ws mighty funny----A>[iiA>ZHuh! I call it exasperating.A>[iiA>ZWe wonA>Wt fight over words. What I mean is, in a case like this, whenitwo chaps whose hearing is all right, spread like the prongs of aisling-shot--well, itA>Ws queer.A>[iiA>ZI get you. But thereA>Ws one explanation: we must be hunting two fellowsiinstead of one. Each of us got after one, and as they scattered, weiscattered, too.A>[iiA>ZBut where are the two?A>[iiA>ZTheyA>Wve either slipped us or outrun us. Or one may have got away, andithe other may be hiding within a dozen feet of us.A>[iiA>ZItA>Ws not impossible,A>[ Sam admitted. A>ZBut if we search----A>[iiTo the left--but not far--something stirred. Sam sprang in theidirection of the sounds, which at once grew louder and unmistakable.iThe hunt was on again, and the quarry was fleeing with more thought ofispeed than of secrecy.iiThe Shark was hard on SamA>Ws heels. On they went, recklessly and almostiblindly; for the chase led through dense growth and kept well awayifrom the fire for a time. It bore toward the lake; turned back; soughtithe deeper woods. Once their course skirted the forefront of flames,iand in the glare the boys had glimpses of the fugitive. Then it droveistraight through thickets they might have thought impenetrable at anyiother time. The country grew more irregular in surface. Twice theyiskirted marshy spots among the hillocks. They climbed low ridges andidashed down into little valleys. In spite of their best efforts theyicould not be sure they were gaining. They might be running like houndsion a fresh scent, but the game was traveling like a frightened rabbit.iYet, though they might not draw up on the fugitive, they were so closeito him that he no longer had a chance to drop unnoticed and let themioverrun his hiding place.iiFor a second time they found themselves on the shore. Then the hareidoubled, and led them in an irregular course toward the broken ground.iAnd now the Shark was dropping behind, but Sam was beginning to gain.iHe could hear the heavy panting of the one who fled before him. Againihe had glimpses of the scurrying figure. The light was increasing;ifor the fellow seemed to be heading straight for the fire. Sam sparedibreath for an astonished exclamation. He was nearing certainty that heirecognized Jack Hagle!iiWhy should Hagle take so much trouble to avoid a meeting? Sam puzzlediover the problem even as he ran. He raised his voice and called, notiloudly, to be sure--he lacked wind for a shout--but with sufficientistrength to make sure that the hail reached HagleA>Ws ears. And JackA>Wsionly response was a desperate spurt, which for a moment increased hisilead.iiDoubt of the otherA>Ws sanity seized Sam. Jack now was following a courseiwhich bade fair to carry him right into the heart of the conflagration.iA second call produced even less effect than the first; for HagleicouldnA>Wt spurt again. Sam began to close the gap between them. It wasito be measured in feet rather than in yards; then it was a case ofiinches intervening between SamA>Ws outstretched hand and JackA>Ws shoulder.iBut the fire was very near now. The glare was all about them; the heatiwas becoming oppressive; the roar of the flames was in their ears.iiA>ZStop! Stop!A>[ Sam panted. A>ZYou--you crazy loon--whatA>Ws the matter withiyou?A>[iiHagle didnA>Wt stop. Instead, he dodged. The movement saved him fromiSamA>Ws descending hand. He plunged blindly down a slope into one of theitiny, pocket-like valleys of the region, which at the moment chanced toibe like a peninsula in a sea of fire; for the brush about it was ablazeion every side except that by which he entered.iiSam saw the danger, and was convinced that fear must have driven Hagleimad. He checked his pursuit; Jack was running straight into a trap. Heicalled out, A>ZCome back! Come back!A>[ but Jack gave no heed. He appeared,ithough, to wake to the peril. At least, he changed course slightly, toiavoid a miry pool which lay at the bottom of the depression.iiIt was as if Sam were looking into a cup, down the slope of whichiHagle was slipping. He saw the boy stumble, recover balance, slide toithe very edge of the pool; hesitate for a fraction of a second; beginito struggle wildly. There was an instant in which Sam failed to graspithe otherA>Ws predicament. Then he perceived that Hagle had been caughtiin the treacherous footing of the bog; that in spite of his franticiefforts to extricate himself he was sinking rapidly; that already heiwas mired to the knees.iiSam knew something of the very real peril of the case; quicksands wereihardly more engulfing than some of these swampy spots; while the fireiadded immensely to the need of prompt and efficient aid.iiHe paused long enough for swift survey of the hollow, of the treesioverhanging it, of the advancing flames. By his reckoning there wasistill time to rescue Hagle, though there was not a moment to waste. Heicaught a stout branch extending over the pool; clinging to it with oneihand, he swung himself down the bank. The branch bent under his weight,ibut it was sound and of tough fibre. With its help he found that,ikeeping his feet on comparatively firm ground, he could lean toward theibog and grasp JackA>Ws collar.iiA>ZSteady, there! Keep your head. Try to work one leg free at a time, andiweA>Wll wiggle out, somehow,A>[ he encouraged.iiHagle yielded obedience. Whatever he might have feared from Sam was aitrifle compared with his new, and wholly reasonable, fear of the bogiand the fire. He did his best to carry out orders; of that there couldibe no question. But it was no slight task which was to be accomplished.iLeft to himself, Jack must steadily have sunk deeper in the ooze, andieven with SamA>Ws assistance he could do little more at first than checkithe sinking. He caught desperately at roots and brush within reach.iHe floundered almost in the fashion of a novice treading water, nowibringing a foot to the surface only to feel its mate becoming moreideeply submerged. Sam tugged and pulled, now this way, now that,itesting at once the resistance of HagleA>Ws weight, plus the pull of theibog, and the elasticity of the bough, which was his own dependence inithe emergency.iiThen the fire came over the ridge, which formed the lip of the cup-likeidepression. Sam had realized that this soon must happen, and thatiit had not happened earlier was due to some lucky combination oficircumstances, including a greater degree of moisture near the poolithan on higher ground. Now, though, a fierce gust caught the flames andiswept them along. Little trails of yellow gleamed on the trunk of theitree nearest him, as the bark caught and blazed up. A heap of woodsyidebris burst into flame. The heat grew intense. Hagle, in new panic,ilet go of the brush and clutched wildly at Sam. There was a second iniwhich the branch, bending under its double burden, threatened to break;ibut, though it creaked dismally, there was no sharp crack of fractureiwhich Sam dreaded to hear. And then, like a most timely re"inforcementito a sorely pressed army, came the Shark, panting from his run, halfiblinded by sweat and smoke, but with his brain in perfect workingiorder.iiWhat the Shark did was simple, but it was done quickly. He picked theibest footing that was to be had--it was none too sure footing, at that.iHe tore off his jacket, tossed an end of the garment within HagleA>Wsireach.iiA>ZHi there! Let--let Sam alone and hitch on to this!A>[ he shouted,ibriskly, if brokenly.iiOnce more Hagle obeyed. He caught the coat and clung to it as aidrowning man might cling to a rope. The Shark braced himself as well asihe could, and pulled. Sam gave an extra tug at HagleA>Ws collar. Theiricombined efforts began to count. Jack succeeded in freeing one leg fromithe mire, and in keeping it free. Then slowly but surely he managed toidraw the other from its imprisonment. The Shark threw every ounce heihad into a final magnificent pull. Sam at precisely the right instantirelaxed his grip on Jack, who half fell, half was dragged toward theiShark, went down at full length, floundered frantically--and crawlediand sprawled to firmer ground. The Shark helped him to his feet, andiSam, who had swung himself down from his bough, got an arm about him.iiThere still remained an open path for escape from the fire, thoughiit was clear that this way would soon be closed; for the flames wereiflanking the hollow much as they had surrounded the camp. There wasino need to urge going while the going was good. Jack did not dare toilook back, but Sam and the Shark, when they mounted the slope, pausedito survey swiftly the magnificent, if terrifying, spectacle. Far toileft and right ran the surf-like blaze, rising and falling in longibillows, breaking as combers break, with showers of fiery spray drivingibefore the strong wind. Involuntarily Sam caught his breath. The savageisplendor of it all laid hold upon him, fascinated him. It was left toithe Shark to recall him to the practical aspects of their situation byia speech which, oddly enough, was no more practical than SamA>Ws stirringifancy.iiA>ZHuh! Wonder how many millions are going to waste! Geeminy! but IA>Wdilike to figure it out!A>[iiA>ZMillions? Millions of what?A>[ Sam asked in bewilderment.iiA>ZHuh! Thermal units, of course!A>[ quoth the Shark.iiA>ZTher--ther----?A>[ Sam began; checked himself; laughed explosively;iwheeled and began to lead Jack down the pitch on the farther side ofithe rise.iiThe Shark followed. He made no effort to resume the discussion, andiseemed to be content to hurry after his companions.iiiiiCHAPTER XXIII AN OLD SCORE SETTLEDiiiSam, the Shark and Hagle made for the lake shore. This was not so muchibecause of any far-seeing, definite plan, as because this was theiline of least resistance, so to speak, and because the lake itselfioffered escape, should the fire cut them off from flight by land. Hagleidisplayed utter docility. He had done his utmost to evade capture, but,ionce in the custody of his pursuers, no lamb could have offered lessiresistance.iiAt this point there was still a fairly broad belt of woods which theifire had not penetrated, and Sam, presently, slackened his pace. Comingito a little glade, he pulled up.iiA>ZWeA>Wre all right now,A>[ he told the others. A>ZWeA>Wve got a breathingispell--chance to rest and get our bearings.A>[iiJack Hagle sank weakly to the ground. The Shark sat down, and claspedihis hands about his knees. Sam turned for inspection of theiriposition. There was smoke in the air; the fire was visible throughithe trees; but by his calculation they could remain where they wereifor a time without rashness. Either the big fire was serving as aimighty torch or dawn was coming on; at all events, there was lightienough in the glade to permit him to make out its extent and even toimark the expression of his comradesA>W faces. The Shark was again hisiimperturbable self; Hagle was a A>Zwreck,A>[ as Sam himself phrased it.iiThere was a pause. Sam ended the silence.iiA>ZJack!A>[iiHagle raised his head, but didnA>Wt answer.iiA>ZJack! What made you beat it--run away from us?A>[iiA>ZI----A>[ HagleA>Ws voice was faint and tremulous. A>ZI--I donA>Wt know.A>[iiA>ZRot!A>[ snapped the Shark.iiSam motioned to his friend to hold his peace. A>ZThen you took a lot ofineedless trouble, Jack. What was your idea, anyway?A>[iiAgain Hagle failed to respond.iiA>ZLook here,A>[ Sam argued. A>ZYou are making a big mistake. If you had anyigood reason for being in the woods at this time of night, youA>Wd betterigive it. If you donA>Wt, everybodyA>Wll believe there was a bad reason. Andiwith this big fire--I say, Hagle, I shouldnA>Wt like to be blamed foristarting it, even by accident.A>[iiA>ZBut it was going, when----A>[ Hagle began impulsively, but stoppediabruptly.iiA>ZWhen you came across the pond in a boat?A>[iiA>ZI didnA>Wt say I----A>[ Again Jack broke off in the middle of a sentence.iiA>ZBut didnA>Wt you?A>[iiThe Shark had been chafing on the bit, as it were; and now he spokeiforcefully:iiA>ZWhatA>Ws the matter with you, Hagle? HavenA>Wt you got the backbone of airabbit? HavenA>Wt you any gratitude? Say, did you ever hear that wordiA>VgratitudeA>W before? DonA>Wt you know Sam saved you just now just asisurely as if heA>Wd carried you out of a burning house and down a ladder?iDonA>Wt you know that if it hadnA>Wt been for him, youA>Wd be up to youriarmpits in that bog by this time, with the fire all around you? If youidonA>Wt know it, I know it, and you can take my word itA>Ws true. And toisee you acting the way youA>Wre acting--huh! but itA>Ws sickening! Getithat, and get it straight, will you?A>[iiPerhaps, after all, this treatment was what the case demanded. Hagleicowered under the attack, but when the Shark paused, he raised hisihead. There was, of a sudden, an air almost of resolution about him.iiA>ZI--IA>Wll tell you fellows. I know Sam saved me--Sam, and you, Shark.A>[iiA>ZRats! Leave me out!A>[ growled the youth especially addressed.iiA>ZI wonA>Wt--I canA>Wt! You helped. And I am grateful--I _am_!iOnly--onlyA>[--Jack faltered miserably--A>Zonly what is there for me toitell?A>[iiA>ZYou came over in a boat?A>[ Sam suggested. A>ZWe saw one drifting awayifrom shore--it was yours, wasnA>Wt it?A>[iiA>ZI--I suppose so.A>[iiA>ZWhy did you come across at night?A>[iiA>ZThe fire had started up again. We--I mean, I--I saw the glow. Iihappened to be awake and looked out of the window. So I dressed, anditook the boat, and rowed over, to see--to see how much of a start itiwas getting. And that--thatA>Ws the truth, Sam!A>[iiNeither of his hearers had missed the inadvertent use of the pluralipronoun. They exchanged swift glances at the betraying A>Zwe.A>[ The Sharkiwould have spoken, but Sam raised a warning hand.iiA>ZItA>Ws queer, Jack, that you didnA>Wt give the alarm to the people in theicottages.A>[iiA>ZIt seems queer now, but--but it--it didnA>Wt look like much of a fire.A>[iiA>ZMaybe you thought you could put it out?A>[iiHagle squared his shoulders. A>ZNo; I wasnA>Wt thinking of that part of it.A>[iiA>ZThen perhaps you expected to wake us?A>[iiA>ZNo; I came across just to--to look at things.A>[iiThere was a little pause. Then said Sam, very quietly:iiA>ZJack, taking your word for what you did or didnA>Wt do, I donA>Wt see whyiyou bolted away from us.A>[iiHagleA>Ws shoulders sagged again. A>ZI--I guess thereA>Ws no--no sensibleiexplanation for that.A>[iiA>ZYou didnA>Wt try to fight the fire, did you?A>[iiA>ZWhatA>Wd have been the use? It was too big to tackle.A>[iiA>ZYouA>Wve nothing more to tell us?A>[iiJack hesitated. A>ZNo; I--I guess not,A>[ he said at last.iiSam got upon his feet; the Shark also rose.iiA>ZWell,A>[ said the former, A>ZweA>Wll talk this over later on. Meanwhile,iletA>Ws get along to the shore; this spotA>Wll be too hot to hold usipresently. Come on, Hagle!A>[iiThere was a rustle of brush at the side of the clearing, and a figureiappeared. It came forward confidently. Sam spoke sharply.iiA>ZZorn!A>[ he said.iiA>ZHuh! Who else would it be?A>[ growled the Shark.iiJack Hagle had been about to rise, in obedience to SamA>Ws call, but atisight of the newcomer he seemed to change his intention, and pausedimidway in the movement, resting on his knees. His glance went swiftlyifrom Zorn to Sam, and then back to Zorn.iiThe Shark wasted no time in courteous preliminaries.iiA>ZWhat do you want, Zorn?A>[ he asked bluntly.iiA>ZNone of your business!A>[ the other retorted.iiA>ZWhat are you doing here?A>[iiZorn did not pay the Shark the compliment of appearing to hear him.iiA>ZHagle, I want you,A>[ he said roughly. A>ZGet up!A>[iiThen a curious thing happened--curious, that is, according to the ideasiof every boy in the glade. Jack Hagle did not obey his masterA>Ws voice.iiA>ZGet up!A>[ roared Zorn. A>ZYouA>Wre coming with me, and youA>Wre coming on theijump!A>[iiA>ZHold on there!A>[ Sam interposed. A>ZHagle is going to do as he pleases.A>[iiZorn turned on Sam. A>ZYou keep out of this, Parker! DonA>Wt you suppose Iisee through your scheme to break up my crowd? You want to get Jack offiby himself, and pump him dry of all he knows and a lot of things heidoesnA>Wt know. And that I wonA>Wt stand for!... Hagle, you come with me!A>[iiBut Jack, still on his knees, merely began to whimper weakly. Zornistrode toward him; found Sam in the way; attempted to thrust himiaside. It was a violent push rather than a blow, but it served just asieffectively as a challenge.iiSam struck back, and struck hard. The time for the inevitable physicaliclash with his enemy had arrived, the battle which must be foughtiout. The blow caught Zorn on the shoulder. He reeled under its force;iregained balance; struck, in turn. SamA>Ws guard saved him, and inianother instant the two were at it, in full earnest, fighting ratherithan boxing, boring in furiously, more intent on inflicting damage thanion avoiding it.iiIn height, weight and reach they were not badly matched, though suchiadvantage as there was, lay with Zorn. Both had some slight, haphazarditraining with the gloves, after the customary manner of activeischoolboys. Both, too, had inklings of the rules; though, to tell theitruth, neither paid much heed to them. Sam, to be sure, would notiwittingly strike an adversary below the belt, and it is to be recordedithat Zorn made no attempt, apparently, to get in a foul blow; butineither bothered himself about the niceties of procedure. Almost at theioutset they came to a clinch, and staggered about the clearing, lockediin hostile embrace, and jabbing away desperately. Then Sam, who for allihis righteous wrath, was the cooler of the two, broke away, because heifelt that close quarters were profiting him not at all; and there was aispace, in which the rivals battled almost in full form. And here SamA>Wsiclearer head began to avail him. Zorn was getting the worse of theiexchanges. Vaguely he understood this, and charging savagely, succeedediin grappling again with his adversary.iiHagle watched the fight as if spellbound. The Shark looked on,icritically, if not without prejudice. He knew that both Sam and Zorniwere far from fresh, and speculated not a little at the vigor of theicombat. Indeed, in his own coldly mathematical fashion he arrived atia fairly accurate notion of the power of the feud between the twoileaders and the strength it gave them in this decisive test. He made noiattempt to interfere. It was one to one, which was fair, mathematicallyiand every other way. If Zorn defeated Sam the Shark felt it might beihis duty to take up the argument in behalf of the Safety First Club;ibut Sam was not yet defeated. Nay, he appeared to be getting ratherithe better of it. So the Shark hastily polished his glasses, assuredihimself that Hagle continued passively neutral, and gave his undividediattention to the fight. It was a good fight--no; it was more; it was aigreat fight!iiJust as there were no seconds, so there were no rounds, no pausesito regain wind. Both Zorn and Sam were panting heavily. Both wereibleeding about the mouth, and a lump was forming under SamA>Ws left eye.iBut a change was coming in the tactics of each. Zorn was growing moreifurious, if that were possible; his generalship was more reckless. Sam,ion the other hand, seemed to be slowing, but the mathematician was notimisled. Shrewdly enough, he decided that Sam was keeping his head andibeginning to follow a definite line of strategy, which involved waitingifor the fateful opening ZornA>Ws offensive was almost sure to afford.iiIt came at last, when the Shark was beginning to wonder at SamA>Wsiendurance and persistence in the new waiting game. Zorn had struggledito gain the prized and effective under-hold; had failed to secureiit; had resorted to a rain of blows with one free arm at SamA>Ws head;ihad shifted his plan of attack and tried to wear out his opponent byibeating a vicious tattoo on his back. Sam, who had been responding inikind, if not in degree, to these attentions, felt a slackening in theigrip of the arm Zorn still had about him. He made a feint of breakingiaway; followed it with a renewal of his more than bear-like hug ofihis adversaryA>Ws body. He worked an arm down to ZornA>Ws waist-line; heidrove his chin into ZornA>Ws shoulder. Zorn began to give under thisileverage. Sam threw all his force into the assault. Back of it was theidetermination which springs not only from a belief in the justice ofia cause, but also the accumulated score of endured wrongs. To his ownisurprise he found a curious accession of strength, as if from someiunsuspected reservoir. There was a moment in which Zorn was thoroughlyioutclassed and outmatched, and in that moment he went down, fallingiheavily and with Sam still gripping him crushingly.iiThe end of the fight was in sight, but had not yet arrived. Zorn,ifacing defeat, struggled madly. Sam pressed his hard-won advantage.iHe knew his adversaryA>Ws stubbornness; he did not underrate his grit.iZorn fought till he was beaten, decisively, utterly. And then, withiSam astride his prostrate body and SamA>Ws fist menacing his head, heisullenly yielded. It was a bare movement of the eye-lids which answeredithe decisive demand.iiA>ZHad enough? Give up?A>[iiRuefully Zorn gave the sign, which told as much as volumes could tell.iSam sprang to his feet, and stood prepared to renew battle, shouldithe other break parole. But Zorn, in truth, had had enough, and toispare. Slowly and painfully he got upon his feet. He stood, silent foria moment, glancing first at Hagle and then at Sam. Jack rose from hisiknees. He took a step toward Sam, paused, turned to Zorn.iiA>ZEd, I--I----A>[ he began.iiA>ZGo with him, if you want to,A>[ Zorn said dully. A>ZWhatA>Ws the differenceiwhat you do--now? IA>Wm whipped. IA>Wm down and out. Do as you please.A>[iiJack was trembling. A>ZI--I donA>Wt know----A>[iiA>ZI do then!A>[ said Zorn. A>ZI know when IA>Wm beaten. He--he thrashed me--IicanA>Wt get away from that.A>[iiA>ZWell, what you got was a good while coming,A>[ said the Shark testily.iA>ZOverdue account, IA>Wd call it.A>[iiA>ZI didnA>Wt think Parker had it in him,A>[ Zorn went on. A>ZIA>Wd been waitingifor this chance at him ever since he refused to trade. And this--thisihas smashed everything. IA>Wm whipped. You three know it to-day. The clubiwill know it to-night, and the whole school and the whole town willihear of it to-morrow.A>[iiA>ZYou donA>Wt expect us to keep it a secret, do you?A>[ queried the Shark.iiZornA>Ws answer had all the surprise of the unexpected. A>ZI donA>Wt wantiit kept secret; I want it told--just as it is. I mean it! Look here!iYouA>Wve got your ideas; IA>Wve got mine. Maybe they donA>Wt agree alliaround, but if a fellow can whip me, I wonA>Wt try to rob him of theicredit. IA>Wm no squealer. I wonA>Wt try to take away ParkerA>Ws credit.A>[iiA>ZAs if that wasnA>Wt just what youA>Wve been trying to do for a month!A>[ theiShark objected.iiA>ZI had a reason.A>[ There was a curious patience in ZornA>Ws tone. A>ZI wasiplaying my game. Things happened my way--so I could make use of them. Iidid use A>Wem.A>[iiSamA>Ws bewilderment at the marked change in his antagonist was beginningito pass. It could not be said that he yet understood clearly the courseiZorn was taking; but he was getting glimmerings of the truth. Defeatiin fair fight spelled disaster for ZornA>Ws plans for school dominance.iZorn recognized this. What was more, he was accepting his reverse withia fair-mindedness, so to speak, for which Sam was hardly prepared. Itimust be, he reflected, that Zorn had his code, which might not be theicode of the Safety First Club, but which he would uphold even at costito himself; he might not hesitate to do unscrupulous things to achieveia definite result, but if he failed, he would accept responsibility forihis methods.iiA cloud of smoke drove across the clearing. Sam was reminded of theidanger which still threatened them.iiA>ZCome on, you fellows!A>[ he said, and moved toward the lake shore.iiThe Shark followed him at once. Hagle glanced questioningly at Zorn.iiA>ZI--I--we ought--ought to clear it up--everything,A>[ he faltered.iiZorn nodded. A>ZIA>Wm willing--if you are,A>[ he said.iiA>ZIA>Wve wanted to--for weeks!A>[ cried Jack.iiA>ZThen weA>Wll do it!A>[ Zorn told him with decision; and strode after Samiand the Shark, Jack Hagle trotting at his heels.iiiiiCHAPTER XXIV WHEN THE TRUTH COMES OUTiiiSam led his little party straight to the waterA>Ws edge, and there almostiat once caught sight of the boat with the punt in tow.iiThere was no waste of time in explanations while the rescuing craftidrove shoreward, or while the four were scrambling aboard. Then Stepiand Poke backed away from the beach, not resting on their oars untilithe boat was perhaps a hundred yards from the land.iiThe presence of Zorn and Hagle, SamA>Ws battered countenance, a notiwholly convincing increase in the SharkA>Ws indifference of manner--noneiof these things escaped the observation of the other members of theiclub. There was light enough for such study; all along the shore wereiblazing beacons, huge if smoky torches. The spectacle afforded by theifire, indeed, was now at its finest, and the boat gave a splendid viewiof the long, fiery line and its weirdly reflected splendors on theisurface of the water; but Orkney, Step, Poke, Herman and the Trojanigave a dozen thoughts to Sam and his adventures to one bestowed on theiconflagration so near at hand.iiA>ZWhew! ThatA>Ws what I call a real flare-up,A>[ Step declared, but with noimarked enthusiasm.iiA>ZOur campA>Ws gone, of course?A>[ queried Sam.iiA>ZYes. We saved some of the truck, though.A>[iiA>ZAnd you woke up the folks across the lake?A>[iiA>ZYou bet we did! They sent to town for help.A>[iiThere was a pause in the talk. Hagle, unhappily aware of theiinterested, if unobtrusive, scrutiny to which he was subjected, satiwith bowed head. Sam glanced at him doubtfully. The cowering youth wasiin marked contrast to Zorn who sat erect, and whose expression wasidetermined, if not defiant. The pair had a story to tell, a story theiclub was eager to hear, but how was it to be begun?iiStep precipitated matters.iiA>ZSay, Sam! Picked up company, didnA>Wt you? We--Poke and I--we figuredisomebody was in the woods besides our crowd.A>[iiAt that Jack raised his head. A>ZLook here, you fellows!A>[ he began.iA>ZYou--youA>Wve got to know things. IA>Wll start at the beginning. You knowiall the trouble started when the Latin book--TrojanA>Ws book--was foundiin the desk after the examination. Well, I put it there--and I left itithere!A>[iiA>ZYou did--_you_!A>[ Step blurted incredulously. A>ZWhy, I supposed----A>[iThere he broke off, and glanced significantly at Zorn.iiA>ZI put it there, and I left it there,A>[ Jack repeated.iiA>ZAnd then let Trojan stand the blame?A>[iiA>ZI--I, somehow, couldnA>Wt help letting him stand it.A>[iiA>ZBut one word from you----A>[iiA>ZI know, I know! Only I--I couldnA>Wt manage to say it,ibecause--because----A>[iiA>ZBecause I wouldnA>Wt let him,A>[ Zorn put in. A>ZThatA>Ws my part of theibusiness; I shoulder the responsibility.A>[iiThere was a stir among the club members. Tom Orkney edged nearer Zorn,ibut Sam spoke quickly:iiA>ZLet Jack tell the story--his end of it, anyway.A>[iiZorn shrugged his shoulders. A>ZAll right! Let him go ahead. I wonA>Wt tryito stop him.A>[iiA>ZHereA>Ws what happened,A>[ Hagle went on. A>ZEvery fellow in the classiknew the bully, good notes written in the TrojanA>Ws Cicero. Out in theihall, before we went into the room, I saw Sam borrow the book, andigive it back to Trojan. Then I saw him put it against the wall. Now,ithere was one special passage--I just had to have a look at it. So Iislipped over and grabbed the book. But then the crowd started into theiroom, and I--well, before I knew it I was going in, too. And there wasithe book! I couldnA>Wt let it be seen. So I slipped it under my coat.iIA>Wll be honest--maybe I had a notion of getting a peek at it afteriwe received the question paper. Anyway, I shifted it to the desk asisoon as I could. And I left it there. I--I got frightened. The teacheriseemed to be keeping a close watch, and when the hour was over and weiwere dismissed, I didnA>Wt dare risk getting it out of the desk and backiunder my coat. And I didnA>Wt think--didnA>Wt dream--thereA>Wd be troubleifor anybody. And I meant to go back for it after school, when nobodyiwas around. I did go back, but the door of the room was locked. Andithen--then--well, then, I sort of let things slide. But I didnA>Wt meanito bring harm to anybody.A>[iiHis voice rose shrilly as he repeated this claim of lack of maliciousiintention. He waited a moment, as if in hope that some of the clubiwould express acceptance of this view, but none of them spoke. Then heiwent on, hurriedly and not too coherently:iiA>ZOf course, I didnA>Wt want to get anybody else into a mess. I--IiwouldnA>Wt have helped to do it if--if I could have helped myself. He--heimade me, though. And the way it all happened--why, somehow, I couldnA>Wtiseem to do anything right. He--he had seen me take the book in. He justijoked me a little about it at first, but afterward--after the facultyibegan to poke around--he came down on me like a thousand of brick. Theithings heA>Wd do to me if I didnA>Wt follow his lead! I--IA>Wd always beenisort of afraid of him, but now--well, he was different and worse--ailot worse. And then he mixed in soft soap and promises. HeA>Wd do thingsifor me, all sorts of things. IA>Wd be right in with the right crowd.iAnd weA>Wd run the school! And the way it all worked--you saw that?A>[iHe turned appealingly to Sam, who nodded. A>ZIt was queer. When theiprincipal was asking his questions, it seemed as if all I had to do wasito say as little as I could, and let everything drift. And then he gotime in a corner and----A>[iiA>ZOh, out with it!A>[ said Zorn. A>ZYouA>Wre talking about me, now. Make itiplain. I got you in a corner, you say. Well, go on.A>[iiHagleA>Ws voice trembled, but he obeyed. A>ZEd put it this way: he wentilight on the Trojan, and heavy on Parker and the club. He declared Samihad as good as given Trojan away, and said a lot about your crowd beingiyellow. And he said you had played into our hands. And he told me heicould straighten everything out after a while, when weA>Wd got what weiwanted.A>[iiThere the Shark intervened. A>ZHow was he going to straighten thingsiwithout showing you up?A>[iiA>ZI--I donA>Wt know--I never understood.A>[iiA>ZNo; I donA>Wt think he did,A>[ Zorn corroborated. A>ZI had him bluffed. Heiwas afraid of me. As it was, though, once or twice I had to rough himito keep him up to the mark.A>[iiA>ZLook here!A>[ It was PokeA>Ws turn to question. A>ZRemember that day I wasitrying the flying machine and ended by almost running into you two? Itiseemed to me as if I was breaking into one of those thrashing bees.A>[iiA>ZI remember--and you were right,A>[ Hagle testified. A>ZHe hadnA>Wt trustedime altogether after I voted for Trojan at the election. But I--I justihad to do that! I was mighty sorry for Trojan. And the more I thoughtiit over, the worse I felt. Ed kept a close watch on me. He made meitrail A>Wround with him; he made me do things with him.A>[iiA>ZLike starting that?A>[ Sam asked sharply; and waved a hand at the greatifire.iiA>ZNo!A>[ cried Jack and Zorn in a breath.iiA>ZWe had nothing to do with starting it,A>[ Zorn added emphatically.iiHagle was shaking his head. A>ZNo, we didnA>Wt set that going, Sam. Ed wokeiup and saw the glow, and came over to our house, and threw pebbles atimy window till I woke up. Then we took the boat and crossed the lake toisee what was happening. The boat drifted off. It was gone when we cameiback to where we had landed. Then you came along, and--well, we didnA>Wtiwant you to see us; for youA>Wd think, of course, weA>Wd set the woodsiafire. And it wouldnA>Wt have been easy for us to explain being there.iAnd so we ran--and, well, you know the rest of it.A>[iiSam reflected a moment. A>ZJack,A>[ he said, A>Zif I take your word about theisecond fire, and agree that it must have been the first breaking outiagain when the wind rose, how about the first itself? That first fireiwas very close to our camp. All of us had been away all day. And thatifire wasnA>Wt due to spontaneous combustion.A>[iiA>ZI--I donA>Wt know how it started.A>[iiA>ZWere you--you and Zorn, or either of you--on this side of the lakeithis afternoon?A>[iiHagle cast an unhappy glance at Zorn, who made answer for him:iiA>ZYes, we were across--both of us.A>[iiA murmur rose from the club.iiA>ZWe were across; we saw the fire,A>[ said Zorn steadily. A>ZBut weididnA>Wt start it. It was going when we came along. Who set it, then?iNobody--intentionally; at least, thatA>Ws my idea. You see, there areipeople going through every now and then; sometimes the workmen takeian afternoon off and wander around. Then there are fellows on fishingitrips. Some of them are careless with matches and cigar stubs. Somebodyiwas careless to-day--anyway, thatA>Ws my theory.... And the fire wasnA>Wtimuch of a blaze when we saw it.A>[iiA>ZDid you try to put it out?A>[ Sam asked.iiHagle hung his head, but Zorn spoke as steadily as before.iiA>ZNo; Jack made some motions, but I stopped him. DonA>Wt need to tellime it was near your camp. I saw that. Yes, and I knew it was on myifatherA>Ws land. And if youA>Wd like the whole truth, you can have it. Allialong IA>Wd been letting appearances count against you fellows. Well,ihere was just another chance of the same sort. I figured the fireicouldnA>Wt do much damage in almost a calm, and probably you could putiit out when you happened along. But the burned-over place would makeia fine exhibit to show to my father, to prove the danger of havingicampers in the woods.... Anything more youA>Wd like to know?A>[iiA>ZYes, thereA>Ws a million things!A>[ cried Step impetuously. A>ZYou--you tellius----A>[iiSam stopped him with a sharp, A>ZWait a minute, Step!A>[ then turned toiZorn.iiA>ZYouA>Wve gone out of your way to cause us a lot of trouble. What was allithe scheming for?A>[iiThere was frank surprise in ZornA>Ws face. A>ZWhy, I told you once, Parker!iDidnA>Wt you understand? I wanted your backing--your clubA>Ws backing. IicouldnA>Wt get it by favor, so I tried to capture it by force.A>[iiSam recalled LonA>Ws suggestion. A>ZYou thought youA>Wd work a sort oficrooked political game on us, didnA>Wt you?A>[iiA>ZThatA>Ws it!A>[ shrilled Jack Hagle. A>ZEd always is talking about storiesiheA>Ws heard about political tricks!A>[iiThere was light enough to see the red come into ZornA>Ws cheeks.iiA>ZWell, hasnA>Wt a fellow got to have some interest in life?A>[ heidemanded. A>ZAnd if I _have_ heard how things are worked, why shouldnA>Wt Iimake use of the hints? Politics? Why, yes--if you want to call it that.A>[iiA>ZBut thereA>Ws such a thing as straight politics, honest politics,A>[ saidiSam.iiA>ZCertainly! If there wasnA>Wt the right kind, the countryA>Wd go to smash,A>[ithe Shark contributed. A>ZJust like mathematics! You may make mistakes,ibut if you stick to it and keep to the rules, youA>Wll get the rightianswer in the end. Same way with parties. After allA>Ws said and doneitheyA>Wve got to play fair and work straight, or they go to smash.A>[iiA>ZSame as ZornA>Ws schemes!A>[ Step put in, bluntly.iiZorn sat straighter; he faced the club, and spoke with a curiousideliberation:iiA>ZIA>Wve got to take my medicine--I know it. WhatA>Ws more, I want to. YouidonA>Wt understand, maybe, but itA>Ws the fact.... Now, things have hit meihard to-night. See here! I have had schemes, as you call them. What wasiI after? Why, to be top-notcher, first all around, head of the school.iAnd I saw how to make it. I must get backing; I needed yours. I sawiI couldnA>Wt have it by favor, but luck gave me a chance to put on theiscrews.... Then to-night Sam Parker thrashed me--out-fought me. It wasia fair fight. He beat me, and IA>Wm not whining. I didnA>Wt think he hadiit in him, but he had.... When I went down, though, everything wentidown with me. Look here! Maybe, when you were youngsters, you playediwith toy soldiers. You stood A>Wem in line. If one was knocked over, alliof them tumbled. ItA>Ws the same thing in my case now. DonA>Wt you see it?iI set out to be cock of the walk. I figured I could whip any fellowiin school, if I had to. Well, Sam Parker whips me--and down plump allimy play-things! I canA>Wt be the all-round top-notcher; for IA>Wve met aibetter man. The whole school gets the story; the crowd quit me. Thereiyou have it! First in everything, or first in nothing. ThatA>Ws the game,ias IA>Wve played it. IA>Wm down and out.A>[iiA>ZSo--so am I--but IA>Wm glad of it!A>[ cried Jack Hagle. A>ZYou donA>Wt think,ido you, IA>Wve been having a good time? You donA>Wt think I havenA>Wt beenimiserable? I donA>Wt care whatA>Ws done to me! It canA>Wt worry me asiawfully as what IA>Wve been through has worried me--day and night!iExpulsion--jail--anythingA>Wll be better!A>[iiSam glanced at the Trojan. The fellow who had suffered most by theiplot had said not a word, while the trickery, of which he had been theivictim, was being revealed. Others of the club, too, were looking atiWalker, questioningly, wonderingly. Sam cleared his throat.iiA>ZAhem, ahem! I--I say, Trojan, whatA>Ws your idea--of the right thing,iyou know?A>[iiBut the Trojan shook his head. A>ZSam,A>[ he said slowly, A>ZSam, I leaveiit to you and the crowd. You know, all along IA>Wve felt I didnA>Wt haveia fair deal--itA>Ws been that that cut me worst. WhateverA>Ws done now,iI want to be the square thing--no more, no less. And whatA>Ws fair andisquare IA>Wm not the one to say--IA>Wve been hit too hard. I leave it toiyou, Sam--you and the club.A>[iiA>ZAnd so do I!A>[ cried Jack Hagle.iiSamA>Ws glance went to Orkney, to the Shark, to Step and Poke, and toiHerman Boyd. But it was Zorn who put their verdict into words.iiA>ZItA>Ws up to Hagle and me to undo the harm, so far as we can. WeA>Wllihave to clear Trojan--thatA>Wll mean going to the principal.A>[iiA>ZIA>Wll do it!A>[ Hagle declared.iiA>ZWeA>Wll let the class have the straight story--thatA>Wll be my job, Iiguess. And about the fire--both of us will be ready to testify youicould have had nothing to do with starting it. Anything else?A>[iiSam shook his head slowly.

He said it simply, evenly, with no traceiof gruffness. And Sam understood. They had found the admirable partiof ZornA>Ws code: as he himself might have said, heA>Wd take his medicineiwithout whimpering.iiiiiCHAPTER XXV VINDICATIONiiiIn twenty-four hours the big fire had burned itself out. A smartithunder shower, followed by a soaking drizzle, breaking the longidrought, helped to check it; just as the valiant labors of theisettlement men, re"inforced by farmers of the neighborhood and drafts ofitown firemen and volunteers, counted in preventing its spread aroundithe end of the lake to the pavilion and cottages. But, as a matter ofifact, the lake itself and an inlet penetrating deeply into the shoreiwere the most effective checks. Here the fire burned to the waterA>Wsiedge, and stopped because it there found nothing more to burn; butifor a day, in spite of the rain and the efforts of the fire brigade,iacrid clouds of smoke hung over the blackened area, proof that in theiaccumulated woods waste there were still smouldering embers. In theiend, of course, these lingering fires died out, and the smoke cloudsithinned and vanished; and there was left a scene of desolation andidestruction, a stretch of gaunt, charred and leafless trees rising outiof a mass of gray, ash-strewn debris.iiA>ZKinder melancholy foreshore for them summer folks to beicontemplatinA>W,A>[ Lon philosophized. A>ZStill, they donA>Wt have to lookiat it, if they donA>Wt want to. And theyA>Wve got their nice little,ifancy-painted houses left, and thatA>Ws good luck for them. And inianother year or two, the stuffA>Wll be growinA>W green again--old NaturA>Wiis like Charity in coverinA>W a multitude oA>W sins--and except for theibean-pole effect of the dead trunks, things wonA>Wt be so distressinA>W.iNo; the lake shoreA>Wll be mended a good long while before someireputations is--eh?A>[iiSam was of the same opinion. It would be a long, long time beforeipeople forgot the performances of Ed Zorn and Jack Hagle. Zorn hadicarried out his pledge. He had gone among his classmates, and hadicleared the slate for Trojan and Sam and the Safety First Club. He haditold his father all he knew of the fire. And then he had dropped out.iIt was no surprise to Sam to learn, one morning, that Zorn had left theischool and the town for a time. It was rumored that his father hadidespatched him to an institution, which was celebrated for its strictidiscipline, and which continued its term through the summer. In hisicase out of sight did not mean out of mind, but it did mean that at theischool affairs could go on, undisturbed by rash ambition and recklessistriving for honors.iiHagleA>Ws case was not to be disposed of so simply. When Sam led him toithe principal, he made good his promise of clearing the Trojan. Heioffered no excuses, but the principal guessed shrewdly at the extent ofithe evil influence Zorn had exerted upon the weakling. Hagle was notiexpelled, but the sentence imposed upon the Trojan was shifted to hisishoulders, with the addition that his recitation marks were canceledifrom the day of the test. It meant flat failure for him in the Latinifor the term, and consequently the loss of a year--but Jack made noicomplaint. He told Sam that he felt he was getting off easily, asiindeed he was; and he added, truthfully enough, that his greater easeiof mind, now that justice was done, was worth all its cost, and more.iiThe principal asked Sam to remain after Hagle had gone. He studied theiboy meditatively, and with a hint of distinct esteem.iiA>ZParker,A>[ he said, A>ZI donA>Wt, as a rule, ask pupils to sit as judge orijury; but, in this instance, IA>Wm moved to seek your opinion. Frankly, Iithink you have won a right to be consulted. Now, as to Walker----A>[iiSam waited for him to finish the sentence; perceived that he had noiintention of doing so; spoke what was in his heart, and spoke plainly:iiA>ZThe thing that cut Trojan deepest, sir, was that he didnA>Wt get aisquare deal--I mean, thatA>Ws how he felt. And I felt the same way. Youican see for yourself now how things worked out to give us the worstiof it. So it seems to me, sir, Trojan ought to come in for just theisquarest sort of a deal that can be given him. Of course, I donA>Wt knowihow Mr. Bacon may----A>[iiAt mention of the sub-master, who had conducted the inquiry, theiprincipal made a movement, slight but perceptible. Somehow, Sam knewithat his old suspicion had been justified, that the head of the schoolihad not approved the course taken by his assistant.iiA>ZMr. Bacon is not presently concerned in this matter,A>[ said theiprincipal. A>ZYou and I are discussing it--and only you and I. I believeion a previous occasion we agreed on the desirability of doing essentialijustice. But what is essential justice in this case?A>[iiA>ZClearing TrojanA>Ws name to begin with?A>[iiA>ZCertainly.A>[iiA>ZThen, putting him back where he was in his classes--fixing it so thatihe doesnA>Wt lose his standing.A>[iiA>ZWhatA>Ws the situation--with his studies, I mean?A>[iiSam told him what the club had done to tutor Trojan in Latin, and toiencourage him to keep up his work in the other branches.iiA>ZOf course, sir, heA>Ws naturally had the snap knocked out of him,A>[ heiadded. A>ZThis thing has hurt his rank all around. He--well, he didnA>Wticare: he kept at it more to oblige us than for his own sake. And--well,ithere ought to be some allowance made on that score.A>[iiThe principal looked thoughtful. A>ZGo on, Parker,A>[ he said.iiA>ZAs for the Latin--now, sir, it seems to me he ought to be put backiwhere he was, given the mark he made on that paper, and allowed atileast his average for the time he couldnA>Wt go to class. And when heitakes the final examination, it would be only fair to give him someileeway--weA>Wre not crackerjack tutors, any of us, you know.A>[iiThe principalA>Ws eyes twinkled. A>ZParker, knowledge of what one wantsiis an advantage at times. ItA>Ws quite an order of yours, but--IA>Wveitaken the trouble to investigate WalkerA>Ws record from his entrance.iAnd IA>[--he bent forward and dropped his voice--A>ZIA>Wm going to telliyou something--in strict confidence, understand. If Walker will showireasonable industry for the brief balance of the term--why, I caniassure you it will require considerable ingenuity on his part to failito meet my requirements--all around--on this yearA>Ws work. Is thatisatisfactory to you?A>[iiIf the principalA>Ws eyes had twinkled, SamA>Ws glistened. A>ZItA>Ws more thanisatisfactory, sir--itA>Ws bully!A>[ he cried; and with an impulsivenessihe rarely displayed he caught the otherA>Ws hand, gripped it hard, and,iturning, dashed out of the room to carry the tidings to the club.iiThe boys received the news as good news--the best of news--butieach received it in his own way. The Shark said A>ZHuh!A>[ and blinkedifuriously behind his big spectacles. Tom Orkney wrung SamA>Ws hand. Pokeichuckled joyously; Step threw his hat in the air; Herman Boyd turned aicartwheel. As for the Trojan, after all the chief in interest--well, heivery, very nearly broke down. Probably none of his friends--not eveniSam--realized how hard he had been hit, or how the belief that he hadibeen dealt with unfairly had rankled. At times some of the boys hadifelt that he had been too passive in accepting rather than assisting initheir efforts in his behalf; but now the Trojan left them no ground foricomplaint. With his reputation cleared, he threw himself with an energyiwhich was almost ferocious into the task of making up lost time andipreparing for the closing examinations.iiA>ZI donA>Wt want to be carried through them; I want to go through them onimy own feet!A>[ he declared to Sam, tersely and most earnestly.iiAs has been related, the school and the town learned more or less ofiwhat had happened, though the Safety First Club issued no bulletins.iAnd the former made haste to revise its judgment of the Trojan, andiSam, and their friends. The triumph, in fact, was complete to theipoint of embarrassment. There was something very like an ovation forithe Trojan in the schoolyard, and a cheer, ragged but enthusiastic,iwas raised in SamA>Ws honor--and to his vast discomfort. From far offiJack Hagle looked on. He was practically an outcast now, shunned byieverybody, but prevented from following ZornA>Ws example and fleeing theiscene of his discomfiture; but Hagle, be it said, weakling though heiwas, was happier doing his penance than he had been as the tool of theimasterful Zorn.iiLon perhaps made the best summary of JackA>Ws case, his remarks beingiaddressed to the assembled club, gathered of a showery afternoon in theiParker garage. There had been some good-natured jests at the expenseiof Poke, who recently had brought in the salvage from the Saracen,iand who was understood to be meditating further experiments in motoritransportation, about which he declined to be communicative.iiA>ZMaybe I have an idea, but IA>Wm not advertising it,A>[ he remarked.iA>ZIA>Wm going to take my time this trip. You see, the trouble with theiSaracen, IA>Wll always maintain, was because I tried to fly just a weeitoo quick. As it was, we _did_ fly--a little; otherwise, howA>Wd we haveigot over that wall and into the road? No; I donA>Wt say thereA>Ws going toibe another aeroplane; but, whatever it is, IA>Wm not going to hurry tooimuch. You see, I learned something, anyway, from that experience.A>[iiThis seemed to give Lon his text.iiA>ZIA>Wm right down sorry for that Hagle boy,A>[ he said. A>ZStill, thereA>Wsimore or less oA>W whatA>Ws called alleviatinA>W circumstances. HeA>Ws like aifeller thatA>Ws been needinA>W a bath mighty bad, but when he gets one,ifinds heA>Ws in awful hot water. And he squirms, and wriggles, andisweats, but all the while itA>Ws doinA>W him a heap oA>W good. Why? BecauseiheA>Ws gettinA>W clean. And when the dirtA>Ws good and thick and caked on, asiyou might say, it takes a real bA>WilinA>W out to start it good and proper.iBut I reckon HagleA>Ws gettinA>W his laundryinA>W all right. HeA>Ws doinA>W well,ito date. The next pA>Wint is for him to come out of it with a backboneistarched till thereA>Ws some stiffness in it. And if that happens--well,iitA>Wll be wuth to him all it cost--and a leetle more. What say to that?A>[iiHe might have read agreement in all the faces before him, but nobodyiput the answer into words.iiLon chuckled softly. A>ZWell, then, if none of youA>Ws moved to giveitestimony, IA>Wll say it again: this thingA>Wll be wuth to Hagle all iticost--and then some--if it makes a man of him. ThatA>Ws the truth, anditruthA>Wll bear repeatinA>W. ThatA>Ws about the best way there is oA>W makinA>Wisure it is the truth.... Tell you what, boys! TruthA>Ws bound to come outitop oA>W the heap!A>[iiSeveral heads nodded; but Poke spoke, meditatively, if not doubtfully:iiA>ZI know--only sometimes it doesnA>Wt seem to come running.A>[iiA>ZOh, thatA>Ws jest because it happens to have a long way to go in someicases,A>[ said Lon impressively.
